## Who We Are

We're a small team of product researchers and writers who believe you deserve better than sponsored content and fake reviews. Our mission is simple: help you find the right products without wading through marketing fluff.

### Our Approach

Every review we publish follows a rigorous research process:

1. **Analyze real owner feedback** - We dig through hundreds of verified Amazon reviews, Reddit discussions, and forum posts to understand what real owners experience after months of use—not just unboxing impressions.

2. **Identify patterns, not outliers** - A single 1-star review could be a defective unit. But when dozens of owners report the same issue? That's information you need to know.

3. **Test claims against reality** - Marketing says "whisper quiet." Reddit says "woke up my entire family." We tell you what actual owners report.

4. **Recommend with conviction** - We don't hedge with "it depends on your needs" copouts. We tell you what to buy and why—or when to skip it entirely.

### Why Trust Us?

**We buy what we recommend.** Our recommendations aren't based on which brand sends the nicest PR packages. We analyze products the same way we would if spending our own money—because often, we are.

**We disclose everything.** Yes, we earn affiliate commissions when you purchase through our links. This doesn't cost you extra, and it doesn't influence our recommendations. We recommend products we'd tell our friends and family to buy.

**We update our picks.** Products change. Prices change. Better options emerge. We revisit our recommendations and update them when something better comes along.

### About Benjamin Arp

I started this site because I was tired of spending hours researching products only to find the same recycled marketing copy everywhere. I wanted reviews that answered the questions real buyers have—the questions you can't find answered on product pages.

When I'm not researching products, I'm probably using them to figure out if they're actually worth recommending.
