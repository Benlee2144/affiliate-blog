## Ben Arp
**Founder & Lead Researcher**

I'm the person behind every post on Researched Picks. I started this site because I have a borderline unhealthy obsession with researching products before I buy them. My wife can confirm — she's watched me spend an entire Saturday comparing rice cookers.

The short version: I hate wasting money on bad products. Like, it genuinely bothers me. Not just my money — anyone's money. When someone buys a $200 gadget based on a fake review and it breaks after 3 months, that makes me angry. So I started writing the reviews I wished existed.

### What I Do

For every product I cover, I spend 4-6 hours digging through Amazon reviews (sorted by recent, verified purchase only), Reddit threads, YouTube long-term reviews, forum discussions, and anywhere else real owners share their honest opinions. I look for patterns, not outliers. If 40 people mention the same problem, that's not bad luck — that's a design flaw.

I also personally own and test a bunch of products I review. The ones I don't own, I'm upfront about it.

### Background

Before starting Researched Picks, I was just a regular person who spent way too long on Amazon before buying anything. Turns out that's a marketable skill. Who knew.

I'm based in the US, I drink too much coffee, and I think the Lodge cast iron skillet is one of the greatest products ever made for the money.
