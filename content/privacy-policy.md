## Who We Are

Researched Picks (researchedpick.com) is an independent product review website operated by Ben Arp from Knoxville, Tennessee. We research and review consumer products to help people make informed purchasing decisions.

## Information We Collect

### Analytics Data
We use Google Analytics (GA4) to understand how visitors use our site. This collects:
- Pages visited and time spent
- Device type, browser, and operating system
- General geographic location (city/region level)
- Referral source (how you found us)

Google Analytics uses cookies. You can opt out using [Google's opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

### Newsletter Subscribers
If you subscribe to our newsletter, we collect your email address. We use Formspree to process form submissions. We never sell, rent, or share your email address with third parties.

### No Account Required
We don't require user accounts, passwords, or personal information to read our content.

## Cookies

We use minimal cookies:
- **Google Analytics cookies** (`_ga`, `_gid`) — for anonymous usage analytics
- **Theme preference** — stored in localStorage (not a cookie), remembers your light/dark mode choice

We do not use advertising cookies or tracking pixels.

## Affiliate Links

Our posts contain affiliate links to Amazon.com and other retailers. When you click these links:
- The retailer may set their own cookies to track the referral
- We may earn a commission on qualifying purchases
- This does not affect the price you pay
- Amazon's privacy policy governs data collected on their site

We clearly disclose affiliate relationships on every page containing affiliate links.
