## How We Make Money

This website contains affiliate links. When you click these links and make a purchase, we may earn a commission at no additional cost to you.

## Amazon Associates Disclosure

**We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program**, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.

As an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases. This means if you click an Amazon link on our site and buy something, we get a small percentage of the sale.

## What This Means For You

- **No Extra Cost**: You pay the same price whether you use our link or go directly to Amazon
- **Same Products**: We link to the exact products available on Amazon—nothing special or different
- **Independent Reviews**: Our opinions are not influenced by affiliate relationships

## Our Commitment to Honesty

We earn the same commission percentage regardless of which product you buy. Whether you purchase a $20 item or a $200 item through our link, our commission structure is the same.

This means we have no financial incentive to recommend more expensive products over cheaper ones that might work better for you.

**What we won't do:**

- Recommend products just because they pay higher commissions
- Hide negative aspects of products we link to
- Create fake urgency or misleading claims to drive sales
- Recommend products we haven't thoroughly researched

## FTC Compliance

In accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's guidelines concerning the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising, we disclose our material connection to product manufacturers and retailers.

The disclosure appears:
- At the top of every review article
- In this dedicated disclosure page
- In the footer of our website
