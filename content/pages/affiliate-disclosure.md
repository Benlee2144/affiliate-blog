## How I Make Money

This site contains affiliate links, mostly to Amazon. When you click one of my links and buy something, I get a small commission. It doesn't cost you a penny more — the price is exactly the same whether you use my link or go to Amazon directly.

## Amazon Associates Disclosure

**Researched Picks is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program**, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.

As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases. If you click an Amazon link on my site and buy something — even if it's not the product I linked — I get a small percentage of the sale.

## What This Means For You

- **No extra cost.** You pay the same price regardless of whether you use my link.
- **Same products.** I link to the exact same items available on Amazon. Nothing different, nothing special.
- **Independent picks.** My affiliate relationship with Amazon doesn't influence what I recommend. I make the same commission rate no matter which product you buy.

## My Promise

I earn the same commission percentage whether you buy a $20 item or a $200 item through my link. There's no financial incentive for me to push expensive products over cheaper ones that might actually be better for you.

**What I won't do:**

- Recommend products just because they pay higher commissions
- Hide the downsides of products I link to
- Create fake urgency or misleading claims
- Recommend stuff I haven't actually researched

I've turned down products that would've earned me more because they weren't as good. I've recommended products without affiliate links because they were the right answer. The affiliate income is how this site exists, but it doesn't drive what I write.

## FTC Compliance

Per the Federal Trade Commission's guidelines on endorsements and testimonials, I disclose my material connection to retailers. You'll see this disclosure:

- At the top of every review article
- On this page
- In the site footer
