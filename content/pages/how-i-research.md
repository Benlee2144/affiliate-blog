## The Short Version

I spend 4-6 hours researching every product I recommend. I read hundreds of real owner reviews across Reddit, Amazon, YouTube, and forums. I look for patterns — what breaks, what lasts, what people wish they'd known before buying.

## The Long Version

People ask me how I pick products, and honestly it's kind of embarassing how much time I spend on this. But here's exactly what happens before I hit publish on a post.

### Step 1: Figure Out What People Actually Want

Before I look at a single product, I figure out what problem people are trying to solve. I'll search Reddit for threads like "best air fryer?" or "which robot vacuum actually works?" and read through 50+ comments. Not the top-voted answer — all of them. The controversial ones are usually the most honest.

Subreddits I hit up regularly:
- **r/BuyItForLife** — for stuff that lasts
- **r/HomeImprovement** — for home/garden gear
- **r/Cooking** and **r/AskCulinary** — for kitchen stuff
- **r/headphones**, **r/audiophile** — for audio gear
- **r/running**, **r/Fitness** — for fitness products
- **r/HomeOffice** — for desk setups
- **r/CleaningTips** — for vacuums and home products

I also check product-specific subreddits when they exist. r/Vitamix is a goldmine if you're researching blenders.

### Step 2: Amazon Review Deep Dive

This is where I spend the most time. I don't look at the overall star rating — that's basically useless. Here's what I actually do:

- **Sort by most recent** — Old reviews don't tell you about current build quality or firmware issues
- **Filter by verified purchase only** — Throws out most of the fake ones
- **Read the 3-star reviews** — These are from people who are being honest. The product is fine but here's what bugs them
- **Read the 1-star reviews** — Look for patterns. If 30 people say the motor dies after 6 months, that's not bad luck, that's a design flaw
- **Check the Q&A section** — People ask weirdly specific questions that reveal real issues
- **Look at return rate data** — When Amazon shows "frequently returned," that tells you something

I usually read 200-400 reviews per product. Sometimes more if I'm comparing 5-6 models.

### Step 3: YouTube Deep Dive

Written reviews miss stuff that you can only see on video. I watch:

- **Long-term reviews** (the ones posted 6-12 months after purchase — not the unboxing hype)
- **Comparison videos** — seeing products side by side reveals things specs can't
- **Teardown videos** — want to know if the build quality is actually good? Watch someone take it apart
- **Comment sections** — yes, YouTube comments. People share their own experiences and they're surprisingly useful

### Step 4: Forum and Community Research

Reddit isn't the only place people talk about products. I also check:

- **Specialized forums** — Head-Fi for headphones, Howard Forums for tech, Gardenweb for outdoor stuff
- **Facebook groups** — "Instant Pot Community" has 3 million members and they're brutally honest
- **Wirecutter comments** — Even the competition's reader comments teach me things
- **Amazon "Customers also viewed"** — Shows me competitors I might've missed

### Step 5: Personal Testing (When I Can)

I own a lot of the products I review — the Cosori air fryer, the Dyson V15, the Sony WH-1000XM5s, the Instant Pot Duo Plus, a few others. For products I own, I'll include my personal experience alongside the research.

But I'm honest about what I haven't personally used. I'm one person, not a testing lab. When my recommendation is based purely on research, I'll say so. You deserve to know the difference.

### Step 6: Write It Up Straight

After all that research, I sit down and write. My goal with every post is to answer the question: **"If my friend asked me what to buy, what would I tell them?"**

I include the downsides. Every product has them. If something is great but overpriced, I'll say it. If the cheap option is 90% as good, I'll tell you that too.

## What I Don't Do

- **Accept free products from brands.** Never have, don't plan to. When a company knows a review is coming, they cherry-pick units. That's not the experience you'll have.
- **Copy specs from press releases.** I verify specs against real-world testing when possible.
- **Recommend things I wouldn't buy myself.** Pretty simple rule.
- **Pretend I'm an expert in everything.** I'm good at research. I'm not an engineer, a chef, or a dermatologist. When something needs domain expertise I don't have, I defer to people who do.

## My Track Record

I've been doing this since 2024, and I've written about everything from [robot vacuums](/best-robot-vacuums-for-pet-hair-2026/) to [espresso machines](/breville-bambino-espresso-machine-review/) to [noise-cancelling headphones](/best-noise-cancelling-headphones-2026/). 

If you think I got something wrong, [email me](mailto:benarp2144@gmail.com). I update posts when new information comes in, and I'm not too proud to change a recommendation if the evidence says I should.
