## Gifts That Don't Suck

I hate gift guides that are just random product dumps. These are things I've actually researched (and in many cases, own) that make genuinely good gifts. Organized by budget because that's usually the first question.

---

### Under $30

**[Lodge Cast Iron Skillet](/lodge-cast-iron-skillet-review/)** (~$20) — Sounds boring as a gift until the person uses it every single day for the next 20 years. Seriously, this is the most-used item in my kitchen.

**[Hydro Flask Water Bottle](/hydro-flask-water-bottle-review/)** (~$25-35) — Everyone needs a good water bottle. Hydro Flask keeps drinks cold for a ridiculous amount of time. Get the 32oz.

**[Umite Chef Mixing Bowls Set](/umite-chef-mixing-bowls-review/)** (~$25) — Great for anyone who cooks. Nesting set that doesn't take up much space.

---

### $30-75

**[Roku Streaming Stick 4K](/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review/)** (~$35-50) — Perfect for anyone still using a 5-year-old streaming device or the clunky built-in smart TV apps. Easy setup, works great.

**[Ember Mug 2](/ember-mug-2-review/)** (~$100, but drops to $70 on sale) — For the coffee or tea person who's always complaining their drink gets cold. Admittedly a splurge but people who own these absolutely love them.

**[Anker 737 Power Bank](/anker-737-power-bank-review/)** (~$75) — For anyone who travels or has a phone that dies by 3pm. This thing is a beast.

---

### $75-150

**[JBL Flip 6](/jbl-flip-6-bluetooth-speaker-review/)** (~$100) — Best portable speaker at this price. Waterproof, sounds great, actually portable (unlike some "portable" speakers that weigh 5 pounds).

**[Kindle Paperwhite](/kindle-paperwhite-2024-review/)** (~$130-150) — For the reader in your life. The backlit display is great, the battery lasts weeks. Way nicer than reading on a phone.

**[Fitbit Charge 6](/fitbit-charge-6-fitness-tracker-review/)** (~$100-130) — Good fitness tracker that does its job without being a full smartwatch. Great for someone getting into fitness.

---

### $150-300

**[Sony WH-1000XM5](/sony-wh1000xm5-vs-bose-qc-ultra-headphones/)** (~$300) — The gold standard for noise-cancelling headphones. I wear mine almost every day. Amazing for travel, work from home, or just blocking out the world.

**[Ninja Creami](/ninja-creami-ice-cream-maker-review/)** (~$150-200) — This one's a crowd pleaser. Makes ice cream, sorbet, milkshakes from frozen fruit. My wife uses ours constantly.

**[Breville Bambino Espresso Machine](/breville-bambino-espresso-machine-review/)** (~$300) — For the person who spends $6 a day at Starbucks. Pays for itself in like two months.

---

### The "Money Is No Object" Section

**[Dyson V15 Detect](/dyson-v15-detect-vacuum-review/)** (~$550+) — Look, nobody asks for a vacuum as a gift. But if you're buying for a household, this is the best cordless vacuum I've found. The laser that shows dirt is weirdly satisfying.

**[Vitamix E310](/vitamix-e310-explorian-blender-review/)** (~$300+) — A blender that will outlast most marriages. Not even joking, people use these for 15+ years.

## A Note on Gift Giving

Don't buy someone a product they haven't asked for in a category they care deeply about. Coffee snobs want to pick their own grinder. Audio nerds want to pick their own headphones. When in doubt, get something from a category they *don't* obsess over — that's where your research (or mine) actually helps.
