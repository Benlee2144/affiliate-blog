## How do you make money?

Amazon affiliate links. When you click a product link on my site and buy something on Amazon, I get a small commission. It doesn't cost you anything extra — the price is the same whether you use my link or not. That commission is how I keep the lights on.

## Do brands pay you to review their products?

No. Never have. I've been approached by brands offering payment or free products in exchange for reviews, and I turn them down every time. The moment I start taking money from the companies whose products I'm reviewing, the whole thing falls apart.

## Do you actually test products yourself?

Some of them, yeah. I own the Cosori air fryer, the Dyson V15, Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones, an Instant Pot, and a bunch of other stuff I've reviewed. But I'm one person — I can't buy every single product I write about.

When I haven't personally tested something, my recommendations are based on extensive research: hundreds of Amazon reviews, Reddit threads, YouTube long-term reviews, and forum discussions. I'm always transparent about which products I've personally used and which ones are research-based picks.

## How do you pick which products to recommend?

Short answer: obsessive research. Long answer: I read hundreds of verified Amazon reviews, dig through Reddit threads (r/BuyItForLife, r/Cooking, r/headphones, etc.), watch YouTube reviews, and check forum discussions. I look for patterns — if 50 people say the motor dies after 6 months, that's not a fluke, it's a design problem.

## Can I suggest a product for you to review?

Absolutely. I love getting suggestions — especially when it's something you've been trying to research and can't find good info on. That usually means other people are looking too.

Email me at benarp2144@gmail.com with your suggestion.

## Why should I trust your reviews over other sites?

Fair question. Here's my pitch: I don't take money from brands. I don't accept free products. I make the same affiliate commission no matter which product you buy, so I have no incentive to push expensive stuff. And I spend 4-6 hours researching every product I write about — not copy-pasting spec sheets.

But honestly, don't just trust me. Check my sources. I try to reference specific Reddit threads, common Amazon complaints, and real owner experiences. If my recommendation doesn't line up with what real owners are saying, call me out.

## How often do you update your posts?

I try to revisit posts every few months, especially the "best of" roundups. Products get discontinued, prices change, new models come out. When I update a post, I note what changed.

If you notice something out of date, [let me know](mailto:benarp2144@gmail.com).

## Do you have a newsletter?

Sort of. You can sign up on the homepage to get notified about new posts and deals. I don't send a lot of emails — mostly just when I publish something new or find a really good deal worth sharing. No spam, no selling your email.

## Can I use your content?

Please don't copy my articles. You're welcome to link to them, quote short sections with attribution, or share them on social media. If you want to do something else, email me first.
