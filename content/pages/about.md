## About the Author

**Benjamin Arp** is a product researcher and consumer advocate who started this site to cut through the noise of fake reviews and sponsored content.

With a background in consumer electronics and home products, Benjamin spends 20+ hours researching each product before writing a review—digging through Reddit threads, YouTube comments, forum discussions, and verified customer feedback to find out what actual owners think after months of use.

## Who We Are

We're product researchers who got tired of biased reviews and sponsored content that doesn't tell the full story.

Every product we review goes through genuine research. We dig through Reddit threads, YouTube comments, forum discussions, and real customer feedback to find out what actual owners think after months of use—not just the honeymoon period.

## Our Review Process

**We don't accept free products for review.** When manufacturers know a review is coming, products get cherry-picked and handled with kid gloves. That's not the experience you'll have.

Here's what we actually do:

1. **Research the market** — We identify what products people are actually searching for and comparing
2. **Gather real feedback** — We scour Reddit, forums, Amazon reviews (filtering the fake ones), and YouTube for long-term ownership experiences
3. **Compare specs honestly** — Numbers matter. We include the actual specifications, dimensions, and capabilities
4. **Call out the downsides** — Every product has weaknesses. We tell you what they are and whether they're deal-breakers

## Why Trust Us?

We make money through affiliate links. That's the honest truth. When you buy something through our links, we earn a small commission at no extra cost to you.

But here's the thing: we make the same commission regardless of *which* product you buy. So there's no incentive for us to push expensive options or ignore better alternatives.

Our recommendations are based on one thing: which product actually solves your problem best.
