## Get In Touch

Got a question? Found an error? Want me to review something specific? I'm all ears.

**Email:** [benarp2144@gmail.com](mailto:benarp2144@gmail.com)

I read every email I get. Response time is usually a day or two — sometimes same day if I'm not deep in a research rabbit hole.

## Things I'd Love to Hear About

**Product suggestions** — "Hey, can you look into X?" is my favorite type of email. If you've been trying to research something and can't find good info, chances are other people are stuck too. That's exactly the kind of post I want to write.

**Corrections** — I try to be accurate, but I mess up sometimes. Wrong spec, outdated price, product that's been discontinued — let me know and I'll fix it.

**Your experience with products I've reviewed** — Did you buy something based on my recommendation? Love it? Hate it? Either way, I want to know. Reader feedback makes the reviews better for everyone.

**General questions** — If you're stuck between two products and my review didn't quite answer your question, shoot me an email. I can't promise personalized recommendations for everyone, but I'll try to help if I can.

## What I Can't Help With

- **Amazon order issues** — I'm not Amazon. If your order is messed up, you'll need to contact Amazon directly.
- **Warranty claims** — Same deal. Contact the manufacturer.
- **Paid reviews or sponsored posts** — I don't do these. Please don't ask.

## For Brands and PR

If you're a brand and you want to send me a free product for review, the answer is no. It's nothing personal — I just don't accept free stuff because it compromises the whole point of this site. Read my [editorial standards](/editorial-standards/) for more on that.

If you think I got something factually wrong about your product, email me with the correction and a source. I'm happy to update posts with accurate information.
