### Kitchen

**[Cosori Air Fryer Pro 5.8-Qt](/cosori-air-fryer-pro-5qt-review/)** — Usually around $100, frequently drops to $75-80 during sales. One of the best value air fryers I've found. If you see it under $85, grab it.

**[Instant Pot Duo Plus](/instant-pot-duo-plus-review/)** — The 6-quart hits $70-80 regularly on Amazon. It's one of those products that goes on sale so often you should never pay full price.

**[Vitamix E310 Explorian](/vitamix-e310-explorian-blender-review/)** — Vitamix rarely does deep discounts, but the E310 is the most affordable way into the Vitamix ecosystem. Watch for it around $290-310.

**[Lodge Cast Iron Skillet](/lodge-cast-iron-skillet-review/)** — Already cheap at $20-25, but it drops to $15 during Prime Day and Black Friday. At that price it's basically free for something that'll outlast you.

**[Ninja BL770 Mega Kitchen System](/ninja-bl770-mega-kitchen-system-review/)** — Great alternative if Vitamix pricing makes you wince. Usually $150-170, drops to $130ish on sale.

### Electronics & Audio

**[Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones](/sony-wh1000xm5-vs-bose-qc-ultra-headphones/)** — The best noise-cancelling headphones keep getting cheaper. Watch for dips below $300.

**[Kindle Paperwhite](/kindle-paperwhite-2024-review/)** — Goes on sale during every Amazon event. If you see it under $110, that's a good price.

**[Roku Streaming Stick 4K](/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review/)** — Already a great value at $50, regularly drops to $30-35. At that price just buy one for every TV.

**[JBL Flip 6](/jbl-flip-6-bluetooth-speaker-review/)** — Solid bluetooth speaker that goes on sale frequently. Under $100 is a decent deal, under $85 is a great one.

**[Anker 737 Power Bank](/anker-737-power-bank-review/)** — One of the best portable chargers out there. Anker runs sales pretty often.

### Home & Cleaning

**[Dyson V15 Detect](/dyson-v15-detect-vacuum-review/)** — Dyson stuff is pricey but the V15 occasionally drops $100+ during sales events. Probably the best cordless vacuum you can get.

**[Roborock Q5 Pro](/roborock-q5-pro-robot-vacuum-review/)** — Great robot vacuum that hits $250ish on sale (down from $350+). Best bang for your buck in robot vacuums.

**[Levoit Core 300 Air Purifier](/levoit-core-300-air-purifier-review/)** — Already well-priced around $90, drops to $70 during sales. Perfect for a bedroom.

### Fitness & Personal Care

**[Fitbit Charge 6](/fitbit-charge-6-fitness-tracker-review/)** — Drops to $100-120 regularly. Good option if you don't want a full smartwatch.

**[Theragun Mini](/theragun-mini-massage-gun-review/)** — Massage guns go on sale constantly. The Mini usually drops to around $150 during sales events.

## How to Get the Best Price

A few tips I've picked up from monitoring prices way too closely:

1. **Don't trust "list price" on Amazon.** That number is sometimes inflated to make the "sale" look better. Use a price tracker like CamelCamelCamel to see actual price history.

2. **Prime Day (July) and Black Friday** are the best times for electronics and kitchen gear. If you can wait, wait.

3. **Subscribe & Save** on Amazon can knock 5-15% off consumables and some products. Worth checking.

4. **Check the "Used - Like New" option** on Amazon Warehouse. Lots of returned items that are basically new at 20-30% off.
