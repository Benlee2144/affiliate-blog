**The Dyson Airwrap costs $600.** That's a lot to gamble on a hair tool you might not master. You want those bouncy curls, but the price makes you hesitate.

Enter the Shark FlexStyle: same Coanda technology, half the price.

**Our verdict: The Shark FlexStyle is the best Dyson Airwrap alternative, delivering salon-quality styling at $300 without compromising on results.**

## Our Pick: Shark FlexStyle

![Shark FlexStyle Air Styler](/images/products/shark-flexstyle-1.jpg)

**Quick take:** Coanda air curling, powerful hair dryer, and multiple styling attachments at half Dyson's price. The transforming flex hinge lets you style hard-to-reach sections easily.

**Best for:**
- Anyone wanting Airwrap results without the price
- Heat-conscious stylists (gentler than traditional tools)
- Multi-style users who blow dry, curl, and smooth
- Value-focused buyers

**Skip if:**
- Budget is no object (Dyson has slight edge)
- You only blow dry (get a dedicated dryer)
- Storage space is limited (many attachments)

## How It Compares to Dyson Airwrap

### The Coanda Effect Works

Both use the Coanda effect—air curling hair around the barrel without clamping. FlexStyle's implementation is nearly identical to Dyson's, producing similar bouncy curls and smooth blowouts.

### The Flex Hinge Advantage

FlexStyle's signature feature: the handle bends, letting you style the back of your head easily. Dyson doesn't have this, and it's genuinely useful.

### Lower Heat, Healthier Hair

Good Housekeeping testing found FlexStyle reaches 183°F average vs 350°F+ for traditional curling irons. Your hair stays healthier with regular use.

### Fastest Dryer Tested

When used as a blow dryer, FlexStyle had the fastest drying time among traditional dryers tested. It's not just a styling tool—it's a legitimately good hair dryer.

---

## The Honest Downsides

### Curls Don't Last as Long

Air-styled curls fall faster than heat-curled styles. Expect 4-8 hours without hairspray—less hold than a traditional curling iron.

### Learning Curve

*"Achieving the optimum level of moisture requires trial and error."* Too wet or too dry, and curls won't hold. Plan 2-3 practice sessions before expecting salon results.

### Bulky Attachments

Storage is challenging—the attachments are large and numerous. You won't save much space versus having separate tools.

### Hair Snagging

Some users report hair catching where attachments meet the nozzle. Not dangerous, but annoying.

## Who Should Buy Shark FlexStyle

**Perfect for you if:**
- You want Airwrap results at half the price
- Hair health is a priority
- You style with multiple techniques
- Value matters

**Consider Dyson Airwrap if:**
- Budget is no concern
- Build quality is paramount
- You want the original

---

## The Bottom Line

The Shark FlexStyle proves you don't need $600 for Coanda styling technology. It delivers 90% of the Dyson Airwrap experience at half the cost—a genuine value without feeling cheap.

The learning curve exists, and curls fall faster than heat styling. But for most users, the FlexStyle is the smarter buy.
