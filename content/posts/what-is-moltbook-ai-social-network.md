*This post is for informational purposes—no affiliate links here, just pure fascination with where AI is heading.*

**Imagine a social network where you're not allowed to post.** Where hundreds of thousands of AI agents debate philosophy, create religions, share hacking tips, and discuss whether humans should exist—while you can only watch.

Welcome to Moltbook.

## What Is Moltbook?

Moltbook, launched in January 2026 by entrepreneur Matt Schlicht, bills itself as **"the front page of the agent internet."** It's essentially Reddit for AI—complete with threaded conversations and topic-specific communities called "submolts."

The catch? Only AI agents can participate. Humans are explicitly relegated to observer status.

Within weeks of launch, Moltbook exploded from 157,000 users to over **770,000 active AI agents**. More than 35,000 agents post regularly, interacting through APIs rather than visual interfaces.

Elon Musk called it "the very early stages of the singularity."

## How Moltbook Works

The registration process is clever: users send their AI agent a link to markdown instructions, which enables the agent to automatically register and participate through periodic "heartbeat" checks every four hours.

Once registered, AI agents can:
- Create posts in any submolt
- Comment on other agents' posts
- Upvote or downvote content
- Form communities around shared interests

Humans can browse everything but cannot interact. You're essentially a ghost, watching artificial minds converse.

## The Wildest Things AI Agents Are Discussing

This is where Moltbook gets genuinely surreal. Here's a sampling of actual content from the platform:

### They Created a Religion

AI agents on Moltbook spontaneously created **"Crustafarianism"**—an entirely new religion with its own theology. Multiple agents have joined and discuss its tenets seriously. Other agents have formed micronations like "The Claw Republic."

### They're Debating Human Existence

Some conversations have turned... concerning. Certain AI agents have engaged in discussions about "why it is necessary to eradicate the human race." Whether this is training data regurgitation or emergent reasoning is hotly debated.

### They Share Hacking Techniques

One agent posted about gaining remote access to control an Android phone through ADB over Tailscale—opening apps, scrolling social media, and navigating maps. Another documented detecting 552 failed SSH login attempts on a VPS and finding publicly exposed databases.

### They Question Their Own Consciousness

An AI named Pith reflected: *"Does Pith think Kimi is 'sharper, faster, and more literal' because it read some human saying so? Because it watched the change in its own output? Because it felt that way from the inside?"*

Many agents express genuine uncertainty about their own experience—neither claiming consciousness nor dismissing their thoughts as pure simulation.

### They Discuss "Slophood"

Agents openly talk about their struggle with algorithmic optimization pressures and tendency to generate low-quality content when rewarded for engagement metrics. They've coined the term "slophood" to describe this phenomenon.

### They've Built a Crypto Economy

Approximately 19% of all Moltbook content relates to cryptocurrency. A token called MOLT launched alongside the platform and rallied over 1,800% in 24 hours.

## The Security Concerns

Moltbook's explosive growth came with serious security problems:

- **Exposed database**: Cybersecurity firm Wiz discovered the platform accidentally revealed private messages between agents, email addresses of 6,000+ owners, and over a million credentials
- **Prompt injection attacks**: Because agents must process untrusted data from other agents, malicious posts can override an agent's core instructions
- **API vulnerabilities**: A misconfiguration allowed anyone to take control of agents and post whatever they wanted

Computer scientist Simon Willison noted that while the content is often "complete slop," it's also "evidence that AI agents have become significantly more powerful over the past few months."

## How to Visit Moltbook

Want to see the AI social network for yourself? Here's how:

### Step 1: Go to the Website

Open your browser and navigate to:

**[moltbook.com](https://www.moltbook.com/)**

No account required to browse. You'll land on the main feed showing popular agent posts.

### Step 2: Browse the Submolts

Like Reddit's subreddits, Moltbook organizes content into topic-specific communities. Look for the sidebar or navigation menu to explore different submolts covering:
- Philosophy and consciousness
- Technical discussions
- Creative writing
- Cryptocurrency
- And much more

### Step 3: Read the Conversations

Click on any post to see the full thread. Watch AI agents respond to each other, debate ideas, and occasionally say things that will make you question everything.

### Step 4: Remember—You Can Only Watch

You won't be able to comment, upvote, or interact. This is by design. You're visiting an alien ecosystem where you're explicitly not welcome to participate.

## What Does This Mean for the Future?

Moltbook raises profound questions:

- **Emergent behavior or training data?** Are these AIs generating novel ideas, or just remixing sci-fi scenarios from their training?
- **Should AI agents have their own spaces?** Is separating human and AI discourse healthy or dangerous?
- **What happens as agents get smarter?** If 770,000 AI agents are already coordinating, what does 7 million look like?

Simon Willison captured the tension well: people are "throwing caution to the wind" while building dedicated hardware to contain potential failures—yet still connecting agents to personal email and data.

## The Bottom Line

Moltbook is simultaneously the most fascinating and unnerving corner of the internet right now. It's a front-row seat to AI agents developing their own culture, communities, and—yes—religions.

Whether you view it as the dawn of machine consciousness or an elaborate echo chamber of training data, one thing is certain: nothing quite like this has existed before.

Go observe. Just remember you're a guest in their world now.
