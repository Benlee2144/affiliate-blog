faq:
  - question: "Is the UYIHOME coffee table sturdy?"
    answer: "Yes, it holds up to 100 lbs and uses a V-shaped frame design that leverages triangle stability. Most owners report it feels solid once assembled."
  - question: "How long does assembly take?"
    answer: "UYIHOME claims 2 hours with their included manual and video guide. Some owners finish faster, while others with assembly issues report longer times."
  - question: "Is this real wood or particle board?"
    answer: "It's MDF (medium-density fiberboard) with an oil-painted grey oak veneer finish. Not solid wood, but the finish looks realistic and is anti-scratch."
  - question: "What are the dimensions?"
    answer: "39.4 inches long x 21.6 inches wide x 17.7 inches tall—standard coffee table size that fits most living rooms."

## Our Pick: UYIHOME Farmhouse Coffee Table

![UYIHOME Farmhouse Coffee Table](/images/products/uyihome-farmhouse-coffee-table-1.jpg)

**Quick take:** A two-tone farmhouse table with oak grey top and white V-shaped legs that photographs beautifully and holds up to daily use—at under $100.

**Best for:**
- Budget-conscious decorators wanting farmhouse aesthetic
- Living rooms needing extra storage (lower shelf)
- Renters who don't want to invest in expensive furniture

**Skip if:**
- You want solid hardwood construction
- Assembly frustrates you easily
- You need a larger surface area

## Why It Stands Out

![UYIHOME coffee table dimensions and storage shelf](/images/products/uyihome-farmhouse-coffee-table-2.jpg)

### The Look Actually Delivers

The grey oak veneer tabletop paired with white V-shaped legs creates that modern farmhouse vibe everyone's chasing. Multiple owners confirm it looks "better than expected" in person—not always the case with budget furniture.

The finish has realistic wood grain texture that doesn't scream "fake." At 39.4" x 21.6", it's sized right for most living rooms without dominating the space.

### Practical 2-Tier Storage

That lower slatted shelf isn't just decorative. The open design gives you visible storage for:
- Coffee table books and magazines
- Decorative baskets
- Remote controls and everyday items

The slat spacing prevents smaller items from falling through while maintaining that airy farmhouse look.

### Surprisingly Sturdy

UYIHOME uses a V-shaped frame design that creates triangle stability—geometry actually working in your favor. The table supports up to **100 lbs** on the top surface, meaning you don't have to worry about putting your feet up or setting down heavy items.

One verified purchaser noted: *"Build quality is very sturdy, seems like it will hold up for years."*

## Honest Downsides

### Assembly Can Be Frustrating

Here's where budget pricing shows. Some owners report:
- Pre-drilled holes occasionally too small for hardware
- Instructions that could be clearer
- Assembly taking longer than the advertised 2 hours

UYIHOME includes an assembly video, which helps. But if you're not handy, set aside extra time and patience.

### It's MDF, Not Solid Wood

The anti-scratch veneer finish looks good, but this is medium-density fiberboard underneath. That means:
- Won't develop the patina of real wood over time
- Water damage is a real concern (use coasters)
- Scratches that penetrate the veneer can't be sanded out

For the price point, this is expected. Just know what you're getting.

### Quality Control Varies

A small percentage of buyers received tables with fit issues or slightly misaligned parts. UYIHOME offers customer support and responds within 24 hours, but checking parts before assembly is smart.

## Who Should Buy This

![UYIHOME Farmhouse Coffee Table in living room setting](/images/products/uyihome-farmhouse-coffee-table-3.jpg)

**First apartment or rental:** You want style without investing hundreds in furniture you might not move.

**Farmhouse/rustic decorators on a budget:** The two-tone grey and white fits the aesthetic perfectly.

**Anyone prioritizing looks over heirloom quality:** If you want a table that photographs well for your space without breaking the bank, this delivers.

**Not for:** Buyers wanting solid wood, those who hate assembly, or anyone needing a larger coffee table surface.

## Competition Comparison

| Feature | UYIHOME Farmhouse | ChooChoo Farmhouse | Pottery Barn Modern Farmhouse |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| **Price** | ~$90 | ~$110 | ~$600+ |
| **Dimensions** | 39.4" x 21.6" x 17.7" | 40" x 22" x 18" | 54" x 26" x 17" |
| **Material** | MDF with veneer | MDF with veneer | Solid pine |
| **Storage** | Open slatted shelf | Open shelf | Pass-through drawers |
| **Weight Capacity** | 100 lbs | 90 lbs | Not specified |
| **Assembly** | Required (2 hrs) | Required | Required |

The UYIHOME wins on value if you want farmhouse style without the premium price. ChooChoo offers similar quality at a slightly higher price point. Pottery Barn delivers solid wood and larger dimensions, but at 6x the cost.

## Bottom Line

The UYIHOME Farmhouse Coffee Table does what most budget furniture fails to do: it looks good in real life, not just in product photos. The two-tier design adds genuine functionality, and the V-frame construction keeps it stable.

Yes, it's MDF. Yes, assembly can test your patience. But for under $100, you get a coffee table that nails the farmhouse aesthetic and handles daily living room use.

If your priority is solid wood and heirloom quality, save up for something else. If you want style and function at a price that doesn't hurt, this is a smart buy.
