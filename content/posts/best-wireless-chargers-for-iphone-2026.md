Everyone keeps saying you need Apple's official MagSafe charger for your iPhone. Macworld has a whole roundup about it. PCMag tested like 30 of them. And you know what conclusion I came to after spending six weeks with three different wireless chargers on my nightstand?

The Apple one is the worst value of the bunch.

I'm not exaggerating. Apple charges $39 for a magnetic puck that doesn't even come with a wall adapter. Thirty-nine dollars. For a circle. And then you need to supply your own USB-C brick, which is another $19 if you want Apple's. So now you're at almost sixty bucks for something that sits on your nightstand and charges one device.

Meanwhile the [Anker MagGo 3-in-1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CF56WHV4?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) charges your iPhone, Apple Watch, AND AirPods simultaneously. For $28. With the adapter included.

I bought mine in January after my cat knocked my old charging cable off the nightstand for the hundredth time. The magnetic snap was the selling point — phone clicks into place and stays there even when my cat headbutts my nightstand at 3am. Which she does. Every night.

## The Apple MagSafe Puck — $39 of Disappointment

![Apple MagSafe Charger](/images/products/apple-magsafe-charger-usbc-1.jpg)

Look, the [Apple MagSafe Charger](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ4QQ5W?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) isn't *bad*. The magnets are strong. The alignment is perfect every time. And with the right adapter it'll push 25W to an iPhone 16, which is genuinely fast.

But here's what bugs me.

It's a puck on a cable. That's it. There's no stand, no angle adjustment, no way to see your screen while it charges. You lay your phone flat on this little white disc and... that's your experience. StandBy mode? Nope. Not unless you buy a separate MagSafe stand to hold the puck. More money.

I used it for about a week before the Anker arrived. The charging speed was fine — my iPhone 16 went from 20% to 80% in roughly 45 minutes. But the whole time I kept thinking "I paid $39 for this?" My old $12 Lightning cable charged just as fast.

The Macworld review calls MagSafe "the most efficient way to wirelessly charge." Technicaly they're right. But efficiency isn't the whole picture when you're paying a premium for it.

## The Anker MagGo 3-in-1 — My Actual Recommendation

This thing costs $28 and it folds up smaller than a deck of cards. I took it on a work trip to Chicago last month and it replaced three separate chargers in my bag.

The Qi2 certification means it charges at 15W which is identical to the older MagSafe speed. Is it as fast as the new 25W MagSafe? No. But honestly I charge overnight so who cares. I plug it in before bed, wake up at 100%. Whether that took 90 minutes or 2 hours is completley irrelevant when I'm unconscious.

The build quality surprised me. I expected cheap plastic — this is Anker's budget line after all — but the hinge mechanism feels solid. I've folded and unfolded it probably 50 times now and there's zero wobble. The Apple Watch charger pops up from the back and the AirPods pad is on the base.

One complaint: the magnetic hold is slightly weaker than Apple's MagSafe. I noticed my phone shifts maybe a milimeter when I tap notifications in StandBy mode. Doesn't affect charging at all, just something I spotted.

The Android Police review of a similar Anker MagGo model mentioned "odd design flaws" and I kinda disagree. The only real flaw I see is that the Apple Watch charger angle is fixed — you can't tilt it. Minor thing.

For $28 with the adapter included this is honestly embarrassing for Apple.

## The Belkin BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1 — If You Want Premium

![Belkin BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1](/images/products/belkin-boostcharge-pro-2in1-1.jpg)

The [Belkin BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRRNCZ9W?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) is for people who care about aesthetics. It looks like it belongs in a design magazine. The upright stand holds your iPhone at the perfect angle and there's a spot for AirPods on the base.

I tested the white one. $50, which is more than the Anker but less than Apple's puck-plus-adapter combo. And it's Qi2 certified at 15W so charging speed is identical.

The thing I liked most — and this sounds dumb — is how quiet it is. My Anker makes a very faint high-pitched noise when charging. Like, you'd only hear it in a dead silent room at 2am. The Belkin is completely silent. If you're a light sleeper this might actually matter.

The thing I liked least is that it doesn't charge an Apple Watch. For $50 I feel like that should be included. The 3-in-1 version exists but it's $100+ which is getting into ridiculous territory for a charger.

Also no adapter in the box which at this price point is annoying. Belkin assumes you have a spare 20W+ USB-C brick lying around. I do, but still.

## So What Should You Actually Buy

If you charge at your desk and want something that looks nice: the Belkin.

If you travel, own an Apple Watch, or just want the most stuff for the least money: the [Anker MagGo 3-in-1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CF56WHV4?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20). This is what I use every night and it's been totally reliable for six weeks now.

If you specifically need 25W charging because you're impatient and have an iPhone 16: fine, get the Apple MagSafe. But also maybe ask yourself if the extra 10W actually matters when you're charging overnight anyway.

And here's the real kicker that nobody in the tech press seems to mention — Qi2 and MagSafe use the exact same magnetic alignment ring. Same size, same magnets, same positioning. The only difference with the newest MagSafe is a magnetometer for compass accuracy and the 25W speed. For 95% of people that distinction is worth exactly zero dollars.

Save your money. Buy the Anker. Spend the difference on coffee or something.
