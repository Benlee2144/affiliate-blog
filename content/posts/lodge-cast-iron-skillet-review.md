faq:
  - question: "Is the Lodge cast iron skillet pre-seasoned?"
    answer: "Yes—it comes ready to use out of the box. However, additional seasoning (1-2 rounds in the oven) improves performance and creates better non-stick properties."
  - question: "Why is my Lodge skillet surface rough?"
    answer: "Modern Lodge skillets aren't polished smooth like vintage cast iron. The textured surface still develops excellent seasoning over time—it just takes longer."
  - question: "How do you season a Lodge skillet?"
    answer: "Coat with thin layer of vegetable oil, bake upside down at 450°F for 1 hour, let cool in oven. Repeat 2-3 times for best results."
  - question: "Lodge vs Le Creuset—which is better?"
    answer: "Lodge for raw cast iron value. Le Creuset for enameled (no seasoning needed) and beautiful designs. Lodge at $23 vs Le Creuset at $200+."

## Why Cast Iron Deserves the Hype

### Heat Retention That Transforms Cooking

Cast iron holds heat like nothing else. When you sear a steak, the temperature doesn't plummet—it maintains, creating that restaurant-quality crust home cooks struggle to achieve with lesser pans.

### Naturally Non-Stick (Eventually)

A well-seasoned cast iron pan is more non-stick than Teflon—without the chemical coating that degrades and flakes. Eggs slide, fish releases, and nothing sticks. But this takes time and proper seasoning.

### Stovetop to Oven Seamlessly

400°F broiler? No problem. Cast iron handles any temperature your oven can produce. Start on the burner, finish under the broiler—one pan, perfect results.

### The Buy-It-For-Life Math

At $23, the Lodge pays for itself after your second non-stick pan replacement. Use it for 20, 30, 50 years—the cost-per-use approaches zero.

## The Rough Surface Controversy

### Modern Lodge Isn't Polished

Vintage cast iron (pre-1950s) had smooth, polished cooking surfaces. Modern Lodge uses sand-cast molds that create a textured, pebbly surface. Some purists hate this.

The reality: *"Despite a few downsides that come with all cast iron skillets, the benefits far outweigh the cons."* The texture seasons over with use—it just takes longer than vintage.

### You Can Sand It Smooth

If the texture bothers you, orbital sanding creates a smoother surface. But most users find proper seasoning makes the texture irrelevant within 6-12 months of regular use.

---

## The Honest Downsides

### Factory Seasoning Needs Help

Lodge's pre-seasoning is functional but minimal. One experienced user noted: *"Lodge says it's pre-seasoned, but I've used a new Lodge pan and I would suggest additional seasoning."*

Plan 2-3 rounds of home seasoning before expecting true non-stick performance.

### It's Heavy

At 5 pounds empty, the 10.25" skillet requires two hands. If wrist strength is a concern, consider the lighter 8" model.

### No Acidic Foods

Tomato sauces, wine reductions, and citrus strip seasoning and can impart metallic taste. Use stainless steel for acidic cooking.

### Maintenance Required

Cast iron isn't dishwasher-safe. You'll hand wash, dry immediately, and occasionally re-season. It takes 5 minutes—but it's not zero-maintenance.

## How to Season for Best Results

1. **Wash the pan** with hot water and soap (just this once)
2. **Dry completely** over low heat on stovetop
3. **Apply thin layer** of vegetable oil with paper towel
4. **Bake upside down** at 450°F for 1 hour
5. **Cool in oven**, repeat 2-3 times

After this, cook fatty foods (bacon, burgers) for the first few weeks to build seasoning naturally.

## Who Should Buy the Lodge Cast Iron Skillet

**Perfect for you if:**
- You sear proteins regularly
- You want cookware that lasts forever
- You'll commit to basic maintenance
- Value per dollar matters

**Consider alternatives if:**
- You need lightweight (carbon steel)
- You cook lots of acidic dishes (stainless)
- You want zero maintenance (non-stick or enamel)

## How It Compares

| Feature | Lodge Cast Iron | Le Creuset Skillet | Non-Stick |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Price | $23 | $200+ | $30-50 |
| Lifespan | 100+ years | 100+ years | 2-5 years |
| Non-Stick | With seasoning | Always | Degrades |
| Weight | Heavy | Heavy | Light |
| Maintenance | Required | Minimal | None |
| Oven Safe | 500°F+ | 500°F | Varies |

---

## The Bottom Line

The Lodge 10.25" Cast Iron Skillet is the best $23 you'll ever spend on cookware. Yes, it requires care. Yes, the surface isn't glass-smooth. But the results—once you've built proper seasoning—rival pans costing 10x as much.

Buy it now. Season it properly. Cook with it for the rest of your life.
