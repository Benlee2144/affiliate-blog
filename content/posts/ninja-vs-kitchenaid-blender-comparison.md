Alright so my wife and We have been having this low-key argument for like a year now. She's team KitchenAid — everything in our kitchen is that matte black KitchenAid aesthetic and I respect it. I'm team Ninja because I'm cheap and We think paying more for a brand name when the motor specs are similar is kinda dumb.

So I did what any reasonable person would do: We bought both and tested them side by side for months. She got her KitchenAid K400, I got my Ninja BL770. We've been making the same smoothies, soups, and sauces in both since last January.

Here's what actually happened.

## The Quick Numbers

| Feature | Ninja BL770 | KitchenAid K400 |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Price** | ~$150 | ~$250 |
| **Motor** | 1500W | 1200W |
| **Capacity** | 72 oz pitcher | 56 oz pitcher |
| **Extras** | Food processor + 2 cups | Soft-start, self-cleaning |
| **Warranty** | 1 year | 2 years |
| **Weight** | 9.5 lbs | 11 lbs |

On paper the Ninja crushes it. More power, bigger pitcher, extra attachments, and a hundred bucks cheaper. But specs don't tell the whole story.

## Smoothie Test: Frozen Fruit + Greens

This is what 90% of people use blenders for so let's start here.

Both handle basic fruit smoothies fine. Throw in some bananas, frozen berries, milk, done. No difference.

Where it gets intresting is frozen kale and spinach. The KitchenAid's self-cleaning cycle actually helps here — it has this feature where it ramps up and down to pull everything into the blades. The result? Slightly smoother green smoothies with fewer leaf chunks.

The Ninja blends greens fine too, but you gotta stop and push stuff down more often. The stacked blade design is great for ice but doesn't create the same vortex action.

**Winner: KitchenAid by a hair.** But honestly both make perfectly drinkable smoothies.

## Ice Crushing

Not even close. The [Ninja BL770](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00939I7EK?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) absolutely destroys ice. That 1500W motor and those stacked blades were basically designed for this. Snow-like consistency in about 10 seconds.

The [KitchenAid K400](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LDC75KF?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) handles ice, but it takes longer and the results are less uniform. You get some powder and some chunks.

**Winner: Ninja, decisively.**

## Noise Level

Both are loud. I measured with my phone (not scientific, We know) and got roughly 95dB for the Ninja and 88dB for the KitchenAid. That's a noticable difference in practice. The KitchenAid has this soft-start feature that gradually ramps up instead of going full blast immediately, which helps.

My wife uses the KitchenAid at 6am without waking me up (usually). The Ninja at 6am? Forget it. We tried once and our dog started barking from the bedroom.

**Winner: KitchenAid.**

## Build Quality & Longevity

This is where We have to eat some crow. The KitchenAid feels more solid. The pitcher is heavier, thicker plastic. The base has more heft. The locking mechanism clicks with authority.

The Ninja works great but the gaskets on the blade assembly start getting gummy after several months. I already covered this in my [full Ninja BL770 review](/ninja-bl770-mega-kitchen-system-review/) — it's a known issue. I've replaced one gasket already.

The KitchenAid? Zero issues after a year. The 2-year warranty also gives more peace of mind, even though We hope I never need it.

**Winner: KitchenAid.**

## The Versatility Factor

Here's where the Ninja claws back hard. For $150 you get:
- 72oz blender pitcher
- 64oz food processor bowl
- Two personal smoothie cups with to-go lids

The KitchenAid K400 is... just a blender. A good blender, but just a blender. Want a food processor? That's another $100-200. Personal cups? Nope.

If you're outfitting a kitchen from scratch or have limited counter space, the Ninja's all-in-one approach is genuinely compelling. One motor base, three functions. We use the food processor attachment weekly for salsa and the personal cups daily for work smoothies.

**Winner: Ninja, by a lot.**

## Cleaning

The KitchenAid has a self-cleaning cycle — add warm water and a drop of soap, hit the button, done. Takes 60 seconds.

The Ninja requires more manual disassembly. Those stacked blades are annoying to clean around, and the food processor attachment has multiple parts. I've nicked my finger twice on the blades. Not badly, but enough to be annoyed.

**Winner: KitchenAid.**

## So Who Should Buy What?

**Get the [Ninja BL770](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00939I7EK?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) if:**
- Budget is a factor (and when isn't it?)
- You want blender + food processor + personal cups in one
- Ice crushing is important to you
- You don't mind replacing a gasket every year or so

**Get the [KitchenAid K400](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LDC75KF?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) if:**
- You already have a food processor and just need a blender
- Noise level matters (early mornings, apartments, sleeping babies)
- Build quality and longevity are priorities
- You want the easiest possible cleanup

## My Honest Take

After a year of this experiment, my wife was right. For *our* use case — morning smoothies for two, occasional soup, she already has a KitchenAid food processor — the K400 makes more sense. It's quieter, easier to clean, and built better.

But if I was recommending a blender to my buddy who just moved into his first apartment? Ninja BL770, no question. The value is insane. You're getting three appliances for the price of one mediocre blender. Check out our [guide to the best blenders for smoothies](/best-blenders-for-smoothies-and-soups-2026/) if you want more options.

Neither of these is a bad choice. They're just built for different people.

Now if you'll excuse me, We need to go make a smoothie. In the KitchenAid. Don't tell my wife I admitted she was right.
