**Cons:**
- Less accurate during high-intensity intervals
- Affected by skin tone, hair, tattoos, movement
- Lag time during rapid heart rate changes
- Can be thrown off by cold weather

**When It Works Well:**
- Resting heart rate monitoring
- Steady-state cardio (jogging, cycling)
- General fitness tracking
- Sleep heart rate analysis

**When It Struggles:**
- High-intensity interval training (HIIT)
- Weight lifting with grip changes
- Activities with arm movement (rowing, boxing)
- Very high heart rates (180+ BPM)

### Chest Strap Heart Rate Monitors:

**Pros:**
- Extremely accurate across all heart rate ranges
- No lag time during rapid changes
- Not affected by skin conditions or movement
- Preferred by serious athletes and trainers

**Cons:**
- Requires separate device purchase ($50-100)
- Must remember to put on for workouts
