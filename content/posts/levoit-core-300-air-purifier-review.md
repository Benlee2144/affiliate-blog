faq:
  - question: "Is the Levoit Core 300 worth it?"
    answer: "Yes, for rooms under 200 sq ft. At under $100, it delivers HEPA filtration with whisper-quiet operation. For larger rooms, step up to the Core 400 or Vital 200S."
  - question: "Is the Levoit Core 300 a true HEPA filter?"
    answer: "Levoit now labels it as '3-stage filtration' rather than 'True HEPA' following industry scrutiny. Independent tests show it captures 99%+ of particles 0.3 microns and larger."
  - question: "How often do you replace Levoit Core 300 filters?"
    answer: "Every 6-8 months depending on air quality and usage. Heavy use (24/7 in dusty environments) may require replacement every 4-5 months."
  - question: "How loud is the Levoit Core 300?"
    answer: "24dB on the lowest setting (quieter than a whisper). On high, it reaches about 50dB—noticeable but not disruptive."

## Why the Levoit Core 300 Stands Out

### Genuine HEPA Filtration Under $100

The Core 300 uses a 3-stage filtration system:
1. Pre-filter (captures large particles, hair, dust)
2. HEPA filter (captures 99%+ of particles 0.3 microns+)
3. Activated carbon (reduces odors and VOCs)

Independent testing confirms it captures allergens, dust, pollen, and smoke particles effectively. At $99, nothing else at this price performs as well.

### Whisper-Quiet Sleep Mode

At 24dB on the lowest setting, the Core 300 is quieter than a whisper. You can run it all night in your bedroom without hearing it. This is crucial—an air purifier that disrupts sleep defeats the purpose.

### Compact Footprint

At just 8.7" x 8.7" x 14.2", it fits on nightstands, desks, and small shelves. The cylindrical design means 360-degree air intake, maximizing efficiency in tight spaces.

### Energy Efficient

The Core 300 uses just 45W on high and significantly less on low settings. Running it 24/7 costs about $3-4 per month in electricity—far less than many competitors.

## The Honest Downsides

### HEPA Controversy

In 2023, Dyson challenged whether Levoit's "True HEPA" claims were accurate. Levoit subsequently dropped the "True HEPA" marketing and now emphasizes "3-stage filtration."

What this means for you: Independent tests still show the filter captures 99%+ of particles 0.3 microns and larger. The controversy was about marketing language, not actual performance. But you should know about it.

### Coverage Claims Are Misleading

Levoit claims coverage up to 1,095 sq ft—but that's at 1 air change per hour. For effective allergen removal, you need 4-5 air changes per hour. Real-world effective coverage: **about 200-250 sq ft.**

### Filter Replacement Costs

Replacement filters run $25-35. At 6-8 month replacement intervals, budget $40-60 per year. Some users report needing to replace filters more frequently in dusty or smoky environments.

### No Smart Features (Base Model)

The standard Core 300 has no app control or air quality sensor. For smart features, you'll need the Core 300S at about $50 more.

## Who Should Buy the Levoit Core 300

**Perfect for you if:**
- You need a bedroom or office air purifier
- Budget is under $100
- You prioritize quiet operation
- You want simple, no-fuss filtration

**Consider alternatives if:**
- You need large room coverage (Levoit Vital 200S)
- You want smart home integration (Core 300S)
- You need maximum filtration (Coway Airmega)

## How It Compares

| Feature | Levoit Core 300 | Coway AP-1512HH | Levoit Vital 200S |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Coverage (realistic) | 200 sq ft | 360 sq ft | 380 sq ft |
| Noise (low) | 24dB | 24dB | 26dB |
| CADR (smoke) | 141 | 234 | 223 |
| Smart Features | No | No | Yes |
| Price | $99 | $150 | $139 |

The Core 300 wins on price and noise. The Coway delivers better raw performance for larger rooms. The Vital 200S adds smart features and better coverage at a moderate price bump.

---

## The Bottom Line

The Levoit Core 300 does exactly what a budget air purifier should: deliver genuine HEPA filtration quietly and affordably. It won't purify your entire house, but for bedrooms and offices under 200 sq ft, it's the best value available.

Set realistic expectations on coverage, budget for filter replacements, and you'll be breathing easier within hours.
