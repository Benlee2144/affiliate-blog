Both cost $249-299, both claim industry-leading noise cancellation, and both have passionate fan bases. But which earbuds actually deliver the better experience?

For individual reviews, see our detailed [AirPods Pro 3 review](/apple-airpods-pro-3-review/) and [Sony WF-1000XM5 review](/sony-wf-1000xm5-review/).

## Quick Verdict

## Specs Comparison

| Feature | AirPods Pro 3 | Sony WF-1000XM5 |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| **Price** | $249 | $299 |
| **ANC Quality** | Excellent (8.5/10) | Best-in-class (9.5/10) |
| **Battery Life** | 6h + 30h case | 8h + 24h case |

## Sound Quality: Sony Takes the Crown

The Sony WF-1000XM5 delivers what most reviewers call "reference-quality" sound. The 8.4mm drivers produce detailed mids, controlled bass, and sparkling highs that satisfy audiophiles and casual listeners alike.

**Sony's strengths:**
- Wider soundstage creates immersive listening
- LDAC codec support for hi-res audio (Android only)
- Customizable EQ in Sony Headphones app
- Better instrument separation

The AirPods Pro 3's controversial V-shaped tuning emphasizes bass and treble while recessing midrange frequencies. While some love this energetic signature, others find vocals sound distant.

**Apple's trade-offs:**
- Boosted bass can sound muddy with some genres
- Vocal clarity suffers compared to Sony
- Limited EQ options (basic iOS settings only)
- Better for pop/electronic, struggles with jazz/classical

*Winner: Sony WF-1000XM5*

## Noise Cancellation: Sony Dominates

This isn't close. Sony's ANC reduces 87% of external noise compared to Apple's 82%, based on independent testing. The difference is noticeable on planes, trains, and busy streets.

**Sony's ANC advantages:**
- Superior low-frequency cancellation (plane engines, HVAC)
- Better wind noise reduction
- More effective in complex noise environments
- Adaptive ANC adjusts automatically

Apple's ANC is still excellent for daily use, but Sony sets the benchmark.

*Winner: Sony WF-1000XM5*

## Comfort & Fit: Apple's Comfortable Edge

Despite being slightly lighter, the AirPods Pro 3 wins the comfort battle. Apple's shorter nozzle design and three included ear tip sizes fit more ear shapes comfortably.

**Apple's comfort wins:**
- 89% of users report all-day comfort vs 76% for Sony
- Less ear fatigue during long listening sessions
- Better fit for smaller ears
- Stays secure during exercise

The Sony WF-1000XM5's slightly larger size and deeper insertion can cause fatigue after 2-3 hours for some users.

*Winner: AirPods Pro 3*

## Battery Life: Sony's Endurance Advantage

Sony delivers 8 hours per charge (6.5 with ANC) plus 24 hours from the case, totaling 32 hours. Apple provides 6 hours per charge plus 30 hours from the case, totaling 36 hours.

**The reality:**
- Sony: Better single-session endurance (8 vs 6 hours)
- Apple: Higher total capacity (36 vs 32 hours)
- Sony: Faster charging (3 minutes = 1 hour playback)
- Apple: More convenient wireless charging case

For long flights or commutes, Sony's 8-hour runtime wins. For weekly usage patterns, Apple's extra case capacity helps.

*Winner: Tie (depends on usage)*

## Call Quality: Apple's Clear Victory

AirPods Pro 3 excel at phone calls with superior microphone array and voice processing. Multiple reviewers noted Sony's call quality as "adequate but not exceptional."

**Apple's call advantages:**
- Better wind noise suppression
- Clearer voice transmission

*Winner: AirPods Pro 3*

## Ecosystem & Features

- Audio Sharing with other AirPods

**Sony advantages:**

*Winner: Apple (for Apple users), Sony (for Android/multiplatform)*

## Value Analysis

At $249, AirPods Pro 3 costs $50 less than Sony's $299 WF-1000XM5. But value depends on priorities:

**Apple's value proposition:**
- Lower upfront cost
- Better resale value
- Seamless Apple ecosystem integration
- Superior comfort for most users

**Sony's value proposition:**
