So my neighbor got a dog last September. A big one. Some kind of hound mix that discovered barking at 2am is apparently its life's purpose. I'm not exaggerating — this thing would go off at random intervals through the night like some kind of furry, unpredictable alarm system.

I tried earplugs. Hated them. Tried sleeping with a fan on but it was January and my bedroom was already freezing. Tried a white noise app on my phone but the loops were so obvious it actually made things worse. You'd hear the rain sound reset every 45 seconds and once you notice it you cant un-notice it.

Finally caved and bought an actual white noise machine. Then bought two more because apparently I have no self control when it comes to solving problems.

Here's what happened.

## The LectroFan EVO — This Is the One

![LectroFan EVO white noise machine](/images/products/lectrofan-evo-1.jpg "LectroFan EVO - my pick for best white noise machine")

I grabbed this one first because Wirecutter recommended it and honestly? They were right. Paid $49.95 on Amazon, showed up in two days.

It's small. Like, surprisingly small — maybe the size of a softball. I wasn't sure something that tiny could mask the sound of a 90-pound hound losing its mind at 2am. But it does. The thing gets LOUD if you want it to. I run mine around 60-70% volume and it completley drowns out the dog, traffic, my refrigerator doing that weird humming thing it does.

22 different sounds and none of them loop. That's the big deal here. Phone apps loop. Cheap machines loop. The EVO doesn't. I've fallen asleep to the same white noise setting probably 150 times now and I've never once caught a repeat pattern. My brain just... stops listening to it after a few minutes and I'm out.

The fan sounds are good but honestly I just use the plain white noise. There's also ocean sounds which my wife likes but they're a little too "spa day" for me.

One complaint — the buttons on top are kinda mushy and hard to press in the dark. Not a dealbreaker but I wish they had a slightly more tactile click to them. Also no battery, so you need it plugged in. Not a travel machine unless you dont mind packing a cable.

## Yogasleep Dohm Nova — The Fancy One

![Yogasleep Dohm Nova](/images/products/yogasleep-dohm-nova-1.jpg "Yogasleep Dohm Nova with night light")

OK so this one is interesting. The Dohm is like the OG of white noise machines — been around forever. The Nova is their upgraded version with a night light and 10 speed settings instead of the old two-speed switch.

I liked it. The sound is different from the LectroFan though and this matters more than you'd think. The Dohm uses an actual physical fan inside the housing to create the noise. So it sounds more... organic? Like a real fan in a hotel room. The LectroFan is electronic so the sound is more precise and consistent.

Some people on Amazon are absolutely religious about the Dohm sound. Like 4-star and 5-star reviews going on paragraphs about how nothing else sounds the same. One reviewer said they'd been using a Dohm for 11 years and bought a second one for their office. That's dedication.

The night light is actually nice — soft warm glow, not too bright. Good if you get up to use the bathroom and dont want to blind yourself. But at around $55-60 depending on the day, you're paying a premium over the Classic model for features that are honestly just OK.

The problem? It's not as loud as the LectroFan. On max speed the Dohm Nova is fine for masking normal household noise — TV in the next room, cars outside, whatever. But my neighbor's dog at full volume? The Dohm couldn't quite keep up. I'd still hear muffled barking breaking through. Drove me nuts.

## Yogasleep Dohm Classic — The Budget Pick

![Yogasleep Dohm Classic](/images/products/yogasleep-dohm-classic-1.jpg "Yogasleep Dohm Classic white noise machine")

This is the stripped down version. Two speeds. No light. No fancy controls. Just a white dome with a switch on the front.

And honestly? For $35 it's perfectly fine if your noise problem is mild. I bought this one first actually — Amazon had it on sale for like $32 — and it worked great for about a week. Then the dog had one of his really bad nights and I realized I needed more volume.

The thing I appreciate about the Classic is its dead simple. Plug it in, flip the switch. There's a tone adjustment where you twist the top half of the dome to open or close the vents, which changes the pitch. Took me a few nights to find the sweet spot but once I did it was a really pleasant sound.

Build quality is... fine. Plasticky. Mine creaks a little if I pick it up. The switch feels like it belongs on a desk lamp from 1997. But it works and it's been running on my nightstand for 4 months with zero issues.

If you're a light sleeper in a quiet-ish neighborhood and you just want something to take the edge off, this is a solid choice. If you live next to a dog that thinks it's auditioning for a horror movie at 3am, get the LectroFan.

## Real Fan vs Electronic — Does It Matter?

Yeah actually. More than I expected.

The Dohm machines use a real fan spinning inside a housing. The sound is warm and rumbly and slightly unpredictable in a natural way. Some people find this more soothing because your brain recognizes it as a "real" sound.

The LectroFan generates everything electronically through a speaker. The sound is cleaner, more consistent, and gets louder without distortion. But some people think it sounds "artificial."

I've read through probably 200 Amazon reviews across all three of these and the split is almost 50/50. People who prefer the Dohm REALLY prefer it and think electronic machines sound harsh. People who prefer the LectroFan think the Dohm sounds like a broken HVAC unit.

My take? If you've never used a white noise machine before, start with the LectroFan. More versatile, more volume, more sound options. You can always return it if you hate the electronic sound.

## What About the Hatch?

I know someone's gonna ask. The Hatch Rest and Hatch Restore are all over Instagram and they look gorgeous. Like a little smart home device from the future.

But here's the thing — Hatch charges a monthly subscription ($4.99/mo) to unlock their full sound library. The free sounds are limited. So you're paying $70+ for the hardware and then $60/year forever to use all the features.

For a white noise machine.

Nah. I'm good.

## Quick Verdict

**Got noisy neighbors, live near a road, or share walls?** Get the [LectroFan EVO](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074FL2HL2?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20). Nothing else I've tried blocks sound as well at this price.

**Want the "classic" fan sound and your noise issues are moderate?** The [Dohm Classic](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HD0ELFK?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) for $35 is honestly hard to beat.

**Want the fan sound with a night light and more control?** [Dohm Nova](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RQ812XS?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) but only if you find it under $55.

As for me and the dog situation — the LectroFan runs every single night now. Haven't been woken up by barking since October. Genuinely one of the best $50 I've spent on anything in my house. And that includes the fancy knife set I wrote about last week which, for the record, I also stand behind.

Sleep well out there.
