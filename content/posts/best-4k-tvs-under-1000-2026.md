summary: "After replacing our aging 55-inch Vizio with a proper 65-inch 4K set, I tested three mini-LED TVs under $1000. The TCL QM6K at around $600 is the one I kept — and I almost feel bad for the $900 options."

My wife told me in November that she was "done" with our 55-inch Vizio from 2020. It had this weird green tint in the corners that had been getting worse for months, and honestly she was right — it looked terrible. So she handed me a budget of "under a thousand dollars, please" and told me to figure it out.

Two months, three TVs, and one very patient Best Buy returns desk later... the answer surprised me.

## The short version

The TCL QM6K at around $600 for the 65-inch is the best TV most people should buy right now. Not the best *cheap* TV. The best TV, period, for normal humans who watch Netflix and maybe play some games on the weekends.

I know that sounds like I'm being dramatic. I'm not.

## How I got here

I started where everyone starts — YouTube. Watched probably 15 hours of TV review content over Thanksgiving weekend while my family thought I was "working." RTINGS, HDTV Test, that Australian guy who measures everything with a colorimeter. You know the rabbit hole.

Every single reviewer kept coming back to the same three names in the under-$1000 range: TCL QM6K, TCL QM7K, and Hisense U7QG. The Samsung and LG options at this price point were fine but nothing special. Sony doesn't really play in this space anymore unless you catch a crazy sale.

So I bought all three. Well — I bought the QM6K first, then got curious and ordered the other two over the next few weeks. My wife was... not thrilled about the credit card statement.

## TCL QM6K — The one I kept

![TCL QM6K 65-inch mini-LED TV](/images/products/tcl-qm6k-65.jpg)

This TV has no right being this good at $600.

Mini-LED backlighting with up to 500 dimming zones. 144Hz native refresh rate. Quantum dot color. Google TV built in. Dolby Vision, HDR10+, all the formats. And its actually bright enough to watch in a room with windows — which is where most peoples TVs live.

I set it up on a Saturday afternoon and within 10 minutes my wife walked in and said "oh wow, that looks way better." She doesn't care about specs. She cares about whether the picture looks good when she's watching Bridgerton. And apparently it does.

The blacks are deep. Not OLED deep, but for an LED TV in a bright living room? Damn close. The local dimming does its job without creating those ugly halos around bright objects that cheaper mini-LEDs have.

Gaming was solid too. I hooked up my PS5 and the input lag was barely noticeable. 144Hz support with VRR means everything felt smooth, even on games that cant hold a steady 60fps.

**What I didn't love:** The built-in speakers are mediocre. Not bad, just forgettable. And the Google TV interface can be sluggish sometimes — there's a half-second delay when opening apps that slightly annoys me every time. But at $600? I'll live with it.

## TCL QM7K — Good, but the math doesn't work

![TCL QM7K 65-inch mini-LED TV](/images/products/tcl-qm7k-65.jpg)

[See it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVX8WJ7S?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20)

The QM7K is the QM6K's bigger brother. More dimming zones, brighter highlights, anti-reflective screen coating, slightly better speakers. It launched at $1,500 but you can find it around $900 now.

Is it better than the QM6K? Yes. Absolutely.

Is it $300 better? Nah.

I had them side by side in my living room for about a week. In a dark room watching HDR content, the QM7K's extra brightness in highlights was noticable. Explosions popped more. Sunsets had that extra bit of glow. The anti-reflective coating was legitimately nice when watching during the day.

But here's what I kept coming back to — when I was just watching normal TV, streaming shows, watching YouTube... I couldn't tell them apart. Not without getting up close and really looking. And I promise you nobody in your house is going to stand 3 feet from the screen comparing highlight peak brightness levels.

The QM7K is a fantastic TV if you're a home theater person who watches lots of movies in a dark room and you want every last nit of brightness. For everyone else, you're spending $300 for bragging rights.

I returned it.

## Hisense U7QG — The wildcard

![Hisense U7QG 65-inch mini-LED TV](/images/products/hisense-u7qg-65.jpg)

[Check current price on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F1DWQKXC?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20)

The Hisense U7QG was the one I was most curious about. Hisense has been coming for TCL and Samsung hard in the last couple years. Native 165Hz, VRR up to 288Hz, built-in 2.1.2 channel audio, and it's around $800 for the 65-inch.

Out of the box I was impressed. The colors were punchy — almost too punchy in the default Vivid mode, which I switched off immediately. In Filmmaker mode it calmed down and looked great. The built-in speakers were noticeably better than either TCL, which is a nice perk if you don't want to buy a soundbar right away.

Gaming was where this TV really shined. 165Hz native means it's one of the few TVs that can actually keep up with a high-end PC or the PS5 Pro. If gaming is your primary use, the U7QG is worth a serious look.

But.

And this is a big but.

I had a quality control issue. About three weeks in I noticed a bright spot near the lower left corner that was visible on dark scenes. Did some searching and found this is not uncommon with Hisense — their QC has a bit of a reputation in the r/4kTV community. Could I have exchanged it? Sure. But the idea of playing panel lottery with an $800 TV didn't excite me.

Also — and this bugged a few reviewers I watched, including the HDTV Test channel — the Hisense has some known issues with HDR tone mapping. It tends to display content brighter than intended, which looks impressive in a store but can mess up the director's vision. If you care about accurate HDR, that's worth knowing.

I returned this one too.

## What about OLED?

A lot of people asked me why I didn't go OLED. Couple reasons.

Our TV is in the living room with two big windows. OLEDs are incredible in a dark room but they struggle with reflections and aren't as bright as mini-LEDs. For our setup, a bright mini-LED made more sense.

Also, burn-in anxiety is real. We leave the TV on CNN sometimes for hours. With an OLED that's a recipe for a permanent news ticker ghost on your screen. Maybe modern OLEDs handle it better, but I didn't want to spend $1,000+ and then worry about how I use it.

That said — if you watch primarily at night in a dark room and you're careful about static content, the Samsung S85F OLED drops under $1,000 on sale and it's unreal. Different tool for a different job.

## My actual recommendation

**Most people:** TCL QM6K. It's $600 for a TV that competes with sets costing $900-1200. Mini-LED, quantum dot, 144Hz, Google TV. The value is absurd. [Grab one here.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSRSTJ54?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20)

**Gamers who want the best input performance:** Hisense U7QG. 165Hz native and excellent gaming features. Just inspect your panel when it arrives and don't be afraid to exchange if something looks off. [See it on Amazon.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F1DWQKXC?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20)

**Home theater enthusiasts with $900 to spend:** TCL QM7K. More brightness, more dimming zones, anti-reflective coating. It's the "no compromises under $1K" pick. [Current pricing.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DVX8WJ7S?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20)

**Dark room movie watchers:** Save up for an OLED. Seriously. Mini-LED is good but OLED in a dark room is a different experience entirely.

## Things I wish someone told me before buying

**Don't trust showroom demos.** Best Buy cranks their display TVs to maximum brightness with demo content specifically designed to look amazing. Your Netflix shows at home will not look like that. Every TV I tested looked 30% worse in my living room than it did in the store.

**Budget for a soundbar.** Every TV under $1000 has mediocre speakers. Even the Hisense, which was the best of the bunch, wasn't great. Budget an extra $100-150 for a decent soundbar. It'll transform your experience more than spending $300 extra on the TV itself. We actually reviewed some solid options for [budget projector setups](/best-budget-projectors-home-theater-2026/) that apply here too.

**Size matters more than you think.** We went from 55 to 65 inches and the difference was dramatic. If you can fit a 65, get a 65. The price difference between 55 and 65 inch models is usually only $100-200, and it's the single biggest improvement you can make. If you're also upgrading your [gaming monitor setup](/best-gaming-monitors-under-500-2026/), that's a different calculation — but for the living room, go big.

**Wait for sales.** These TVs all go on sale constantly. Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday, random Tuesday price drops. The QM6K hit $500 briefly in January. Set a price alert on CamelCamelCamel and be patient if you can.

Look — I spent way too much time and effort on this. But the conclusion was surprisingly simple. The TCL QM6K gives you 90% of what a $1,500 TV delivers for 40% of the price. Unless you have a very specific need that pushes you elsewhere, just buy that one and spend the savings on a nice soundbar.

Your wife will thank you. Mine did.
