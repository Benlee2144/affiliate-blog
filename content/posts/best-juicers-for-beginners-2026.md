I'll be honest — I used to think juicers were one of those kitchen appliances people buy, use twice, and then shove in a cabinet forever. Like a bread maker. Or one of those waffle irons shaped like a character from Star Wars.

My wife's friend kept posting these green juice photos on Instagram and it drove me a little nuts. But then my doctor told me I needed to get more vegetables in my diet (my exact words were "how many more") and suddenly a juicer didn't sound so stupid.

So I did what I always do. I bought the wrong one first.

## The $40 Mistake

My first juicer was some no-name brand from Amazon that had like 4.2 stars and 12,000 reviews. Figured that was good enough. It was not. The thing sounded like a blender fighting a garbage disposal, it sprayed carrot juice on my ceiling (not exaggerating, actual ceiling), and cleaning it took longer than actually making the juice. I returned it after 4 days.

The problem was I didn't understand the difference between centrifugal and masticating juicers. Or that cheap centrifugal juicers are basically just spinning blades that heat up your produce and destroy half the nutrients. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

## What I Actually Ended Up With

After the ceiling incident I spent way too long watching YouTube reviews. There's this guy — I think his channel is called Discount Juicer or something — who does these insanely thorough comparisons where he measures the exact ounces of juice from the same amount of produce across like 8 machines. Thats the kind of obsessive testing I respect.

Between his videos and the Serious Eats team's testing (they juiced literal bushels of stuff), I narrowed it down to two.

### Breville Juice Fountain Cold Plus — The One I'd Buy Again

![Breville Juice Fountain Cold Plus](/images/products/breville-juice-fountain-cold-plus-2.jpg)

Look, at $200 this isn't cheap for a beginner purchase. I get that. But here's why I think its worth it: this thing is fast, relatively quiet, and it actually extracts a decent amount of juice without turning everything into warm foam.

I timed it once — two pounds of carrots in about 30 seconds. The juice came out cold, which matters more than I thought it would. Warm carrot juice is genuinely disgusting, by the way. Don't ask me how I know.

The dual speed settings actually make a difference too. Low speed for softer stuff like oranges and tomatoes, high speed for harder produce like carrots and beets. My old cheapo juicer had one speed: violent.

What I like most though is the 70oz jug. I make juice for me and my wife in one batch and it lasts a day in the fridge without separating too much. Some mornings I'll throw in apples, ginger, carrots, and a handful of spinach. Takes maybe 3 minutes including cleanup.

Cleanup — thats the other thing. The mesh filter is the worst part of any juicer and this one has a wider mesh thats easier to scrub. Still not fun. But manageable. I run it under water right after juicing and it takes maybe 90 seconds.

### Hamilton Beach Big Mouth — The Budget Pick That Actually Works

![Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Juicer](/images/products/hamilton-beach-big-mouth-juicer.jpg)

If $200 makes you flinch, this is your juicer. I bought this one for my mom after she saw mine and wanted to try juicing. It's around $70 and honestly? For the price, I was kinda shocked at how well it works.

The "big mouth" part means it has a 3-inch feed chute so you don't have to chop everything into tiny pieces beforehand. Whole apples go right in. That alone saves a bunch of time and is a huge deal for beginners who don't want juicing to feel like a whole production.

Now — is it as good as the Breville? No. The juice comes out a bit warmer, the extraction isn't as efficient (you'll notice more moisture left in the pulp), and its definately louder. My mom says it sounds "like the dentist" which is... not a great endorsement.

But it makes juice. Good juice. And for someone who isn't sure if they'll stick with juicing, spending $70 instead of $200+ to find out is smart. CNET actually picked this as their best beginner juicer too, which made me feel validated about the recommendation.

## What About Cold Press / Masticating Juicers?

You're gonna see people online swear that cold press is the only way to go. And they're not wrong that masticating juicers preserve more nutrients and produce less foam. The Nama J3 and Omega models get recommended constantly — Wirecutter loves the Nama, Food Network likes the Breville Bluicer, Serious Eats champions the Breville Compact.

Here's my take though: if you're a beginner, a slow masticating juicer will test your patience. They're called "slow" for a reason. What takes 30 seconds in a centrifugal takes 3-4 minutes in a masticating juicer. And they cost $250-500.

I tried my neighbor's Nama J3 once. Beautiful machine, whisper quiet, amazing juice quality. But it took forever and the feed chute is small so you're constantly pushing produce in with the plunger thing. For someone juicing daily who really cares about nutrient retention — sure, get one. For a beginner trying to figure out if juicing is even for them? Overkill.

Start cheap or mid-range. Upgrade later if you stick with it. That's my honest advice.

## A Few Things Nobody Tells You About Juicing

**It's expensive.** Not the machine — the produce. I spend probably $30-40 a week on fruits and vegetables just for juice. That adds up fast. We go through carrots like you wouldn't believe.

**The pulp situation.** You will generate SO much pulp. I felt guilty throwing it away so I started composting. Some people bake with it but I tried carrot pulp muffins once and they were... not great. They were bad.

**Morning routine changes.** Juicing adds 5-10 minutes to your morning. Some days I just don't feel like it. Having a fast juicer helps — its the difference between "fine I'll make juice" and "absolutely not."

**Your kitchen will smell amazing.** OK this is actually a positive one. Fresh ginger and apple in the morning smells incredible.

## The Verdict

If you're testing the waters: **Hamilton Beach Big Mouth** at ~$70. Zero regrets if you end up not sticking with it, and genuinely capable if you do.

If you're pretty sure you'll use it regularly: **Breville Juice Fountain Cold Plus** at ~$200. It's what I use almost every day and I've had zero issues after several months.

Skip the $400+ cold press machines until you know juicing is your thing. I almost bought a Nama J3 as my first juicer and I'm really glad I didn't — I would've been overwhelmed and probably given up.

I was wrong about juicers being a gimmick. My doctor's probably right that I need more veggies. And my wife's friend's Instagram posts don't annoy me quite as much anymore. Progress.
