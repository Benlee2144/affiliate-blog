I used to be one of those guys.

You know the type. Plates clanging at the gym, judging anyone with fancy equipment. "Real lifters use real weights," I'd think while watching someone fiddle with a dial on their adjustable dumbbells at the Y. Seemed like a gimmick for people who valued convenience over actually getting strong.

Then I moved into a 650 square foot apartment and suddenly storing 8 pairs of dumbbells wasn't really an option anymore.

So here I am, 8 months into owning a set of adjustable dumbbells, writing about them on the internet. Life comes at you fast.

## Do Adjustable Dumbbells Actually Work?

This was my biggest question before buying. Like, actually work. Not "technically function" but work for serious training.

Short answer: yes. But with caveats.

I use my [Bowflex SelectTech 552s](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ARYU58?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) for basically everything — curls, rows, shoulder press, lunges, goblet squats. Eight months in, they've handled every workout I've thrown at them. Nothing's broken, nothing's loose, nothing feels sketchy.

The longer answer involves understanding what you're giving up. More on that below.

## What's Everyone's Problem With Them?

Before buying, I spent way too much time reading Amazon reviews and lurking in Facebook fitness groups. The complaints fall into a few categories:

**"They feel unbalanced"** — This is true for some exercises. The weight distribution on dial-type dumbbells isn't centered like a traditional hex dumbbell. For most movements? Doesn't matter. For wrist curls or movements where the dumbbell rotates in your hand? You notice it.

**"The plastic will break"** — Valid concern. The adjustment mechanisms on budget models definitely feel flimsy. The Bowflex 552 uses more plastic than I'd like but after 8 months of near-daily use, nothing's cracked. Someone in a home gym Facebook group posted about dropping theirs from overhead and snapping the selector — but I mean, you shouldn't be dropping these from height anyway.

**"Too bulky for certain exercises"** — Yeah. The 552s at 52.5 lbs are about 16 inches long. Hammer curls are fine. Close-grip pressing gets awkward. It's a real tradeoff.

**"Not heavy enough"** — The 552s max at 52.5 lbs per dumbbell. For most people doing home workouts, that's plenty. If you're repping 70+ lb dumbbells regularly, you need the 1090s or a PowerBlock that goes heavier.

## Which Ones Should You Actually Buy?

After way too much research, I narrowed it to three options for most people:

**For most people: Bowflex SelectTech 552**

This is what I bought. $429 for the pair, replaces 15 sets of dumbbells (5-52.5 lbs in 2.5 or 5 lb increments). The dial mechanism is intuitive — you literally turn it and lift. Takes about 3 seconds to change weight.

The 2.5 lb increments matter more than I expected. Going from 15 to 17.5 lbs for lateral raises felt way more natural than jumping straight to 20. That granularity is worth the premium over cheaper options.

Main downside: they're bulky even at light weights. And Bowflex has had some QC issues over the years — I'd buy from Amazon or direct so returns are easy if you get a dud.

**For serious lifters: PowerBlock Elite**

If the 52.5 lb cap bothers you, the [PowerBlock Elite series](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BV7MJDWJ?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) goes up to 70 or 90 lbs with expansion kits. The design is completely different — a caged handle system instead of a dial.

![PowerBlock Elite adjustable dumbbells](/images/products/powerblock-elite-1.jpg)

Someone in my apartment building has these. I've used them a few times. The weight changes take slightly longer but the overall feel is more compact at heavier weights. The cage around your hand is wierd at first but you stop noticing after a few sets.

They're also more durable for drops according to pretty much everyone I've talked to. PowerBlock's warranty covers things Bowflex's doesn't.

**For budget buyers: NordicTrack Select-A-Weight**

Around $350 for 55 lb dumbbells. Flat heads instead of round. Plastic adjustment mechanism that people complain about more than Bowflex.

I haven't used these personally but the reviews are mixed. Fine for casual use, questionable for anyone training hard. The price difference from Bowflex isn't enough for me to recommend them unless budget is truly tight.

## Real Questions From Real People

These came from a home gym Facebook group I lurk in. Figured I'd answer them honestly.

**"Will they fall apart after a year?"**

Depends on the brand and how you treat them. My Bowflex 552s show no signs of wear after 8 months. I've seen people post about their 5+ year old SelectTechs still working fine. I've also seen people break them in 6 months by dropping them or leaving them in a hot garage.

Don't drop them. Don't leave them in extreme temps. They'll last.

**"Can I build real muscle with adjustable dumbbells?"**

Yes. Muscle doesn't know if the weight came from a fancy gym dumbbell or an adjustable set from your living room. Progressive overload is progressive overload. The 2.5 lb increments actually make it easier to progressively overload compared to commercial gyms where dumbbells jump by 5 lbs.

**"Are they loud?"**

The plates rattle a bit when you're changing weights. During the actual exercise? Silent. My downstairs neighbor hasn't complained and she complains about basically everything.

**"What about the ones with stands?"**

Totally optional. I keep mine on the floor under my desk. The stands look nice and make grabbing them slightly easier but they're not worth $100+ to me. Your call.

**"Bowflex or PowerBlock?"**

Bowflex if you want faster weight changes and finer increments. PowerBlock if you want heavier max weights, better durability, or plan to drop them occasionally. Both work. Neither is wrong.

## What I Got Wrong About Adjustable Dumbbells

A few things surprised me after actual use:

**They're better for supersets than I expected.** I thought changing weight mid-workout would be annoying. It takes 3 seconds. It's fine.

**The weight max matters less than I thought.** I figured I'd outgrow 52.5 lbs fast. Eight months in, I'm repping 45s for most pressing movements and still have room to grow. Unless you're already strong, the 552s will last you a while.

**The space savings are legit.** My dumbbells sit in a 2'x1' spot in my closet. An equivalent dumbbell rack would take up half my bedroom.

**Plate rattling is annoying.** The plates rattle when you change weights. Not during lifts, just during transitions. I got used to it but it bugged me for the first few weeks.

## What I'd Do Differently

If I could go back, I'd probably get the [Bowflex 1090s](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000OC5RXE?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) instead of the 552s. Same adjustment system but goes up to 90 lbs. The price jump is significant ($600ish) but having that headroom would be nice. The 552s work fine for now though.

I'd also buy the stand. Reaching down to the floor every set gets old. First world problem but still.

## Bottom Line

Adjustable dumbbells aren't the gimmick I thought they were. They're a genuine space-saving solution that works for real training.

Get the [Bowflex 552s](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ARYU58?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) if you want something that works out of the box for most people. Get the [PowerBlock Elite](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BV7MJDWJ?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) if you need heavier weights or better durability.

Skip the cheap Amazon knockoffs. Seen too many horror stories in the Facebook groups about mechanisms breaking mid-lift. Not worth the $150 you save.

Eight months ago I would've mocked this purchase. Now I use them 4-5 days a week and regret nothing. Weird how that works.
