faq:
  - question: "Is the Ninja Crispi Pro worth it over the original Crispi?"
    answer: "Yes—if you want precise temperature control and more cooking modes. The Pro adds Roast and Dehydrate functions, digital temperature settings, and includes two glass containers. For $100 more, you get meaningful upgrades."
  - question: "Is the Ninja Crispi Pro really non-toxic?"
    answer: "Yes—all food-contact surfaces are designed without PFAS and PTFE. The glass containers eliminate concerns about plastic leaching that come with traditional air fryer baskets."
  - question: "Can you put Ninja Crispi Pro containers in the fridge?"
    answer: "Yes—the glass containers come with storage lids so you can cook and store in the same container. Note that the fixed handles take up more fridge space than standard containers."
  - question: "What's the difference between Max Crisp and Air Fry modes?"
    answer: "Max Crisp runs hotter (almost broiler-like) for extra crispiness but requires close attention. Air Fry gives you precise temperature control for more even cooking on thicker items."

You've seen the TikToks. Glass air fryer. No toxic coatings. Cook and store in the same container. But is the Ninja Crispi Pro actually good, or just good marketing?

After digging through hundreds of Reddit posts, owner reviews, and professional tests—the answer surprised us.

**Our verdict: The Ninja Crispi Pro is the best air fryer for health-conscious cooks who want to see their food and skip the plastic entirely. The glass design isn't a gimmick—it genuinely changes how you use an air fryer.**

## Our Pick: Ninja Crispi Pro 6-in-1 Glass Air Fryer

![Ninja Crispi Pro Glass Air Fryer](/images/products/ninja-crispi-pro-1.jpg)

**Quick take:** A 6-in-1 glass air fryer with two containers (6qt and 2.5qt), precision temperature control, and zero PFAS or PTFE coatings anywhere food touches.

**Best for:**
- Health-conscious cooks worried about plastic and non-stick coatings
- Meal preppers who want to cook and store in the same container
- Anyone who wants to watch their food cook without opening the lid
- Households of 1-4 people

**Skip if:**
- You need to cook multiple dishes at different temperatures simultaneously
- You're on a tight budget (the original Crispi is $100 cheaper)
- You have limited counter space
- You need the 4qt container (sold separately)

## Why It Stands Out

### Finally, an Air Fryer Without the Plastic Anxiety

The Crispi Pro's biggest selling point is real: all food-contact surfaces are designed without PFAS and PTFE. The glass containers eliminate the microplastic concerns that come with traditional plastic and non-stick air fryer baskets.

As one Reddit user explained: *"I worried about [plastic] as well and ended up getting the Ninja Crispi because it's glass. I love it and use it daily!"*

### Cook, Store, Reheat—Same Container

![Ninja Crispi Pro with glass containers and storage lids](/images/products/ninja-crispi-pro-2.jpg)

The glass containers come with storage lids. Meal prep directly in the container, snap on the lid, and put it in the fridge. When you're ready to eat, pop it back in the Crispi Pro and hit Recrisp.

One Reddit user raved: *"I recently got the Crispi Pro and I really like it. Easier to clean and I love how you can cook and store in the same container. It came with 2 glass containers and 2 grill plates."*

### Blazing Fast Cooking

The speed consistently impresses users. Homes & Gardens testing confirmed: *"It takes 6 minutes to make steak fries from frozen on Max Crisp. It normally takes 20 minutes in the oven plus preheating. The Crispi doesn't require you to preheat it."*

Even frozen steaks come out perfectly: *"I can literally take a frozen 1lb ribeye out of the freezer and set it for 12 minutes on Max Crisp and it is a perfect medium."*

### 6-in-1 Functionality

The Pro model adds two functions the original Crispi lacks:
- **Air Fry** with precise temperature control
- **Max Crisp** for maximum crispiness
- **Bake** for cookies, cakes, and breads
- **Roast** for larger cuts of meat
- **Dehydrate** for jerky and dried fruits
- **Recrisp** for restaurant-quality leftover reheat

### Watch Your Food Cook

The glass design lets you monitor cooking without opening the lid (which releases heat and extends cook time). You'll actually see when those fries turn golden.

Tasting Table noted it *"punches above its weight"* and praised the ability to watch food cooking in real-time.

## Honest Downsides

### Single Container Only

Unlike dual-basket air fryers, the Crispi Pro cooks one dish at a time at one temperature. If you regularly cook proteins and vegetables simultaneously, this is a real limitation.

The Gadgeteer noted: *"For larger families or multi-dish cooking at once, a dual-basket model may be better."*

### The Price Premium

At $279, the Crispi Pro costs about $100 more than the original Crispi ($160-180). You're paying for digital temperature control, two additional cooking modes, and the second container.

And frustratingly: the 4qt medium container is sold separately.

### Max Crisp Requires Attention

Max Crisp mode runs extremely hot—almost like a broiler. It's fantastic for frozen foods but can over-brown quickly if you're not watching.

Cooker Diary warned: *"Users need to use thin cuts of meat or slice bigger chicken breasts in half, or the outside gets too crisp."*

### Container Handles Take Space

The glass containers have fixed handles that don't fold. This means they take up more fridge space than standard rectangular storage containers. Not a dealbreaker, but worth knowing.

### Basket Alignment

A minor annoyance that multiple reviewers mention: getting the basket perfectly aligned on the base takes a moment. Once you get the hang of it, it's not an issue.

## Who Should Buy This

**Health-conscious cooks:** If you've been avoiding air fryers due to plastic and coating concerns, this eliminates those worries.

**Meal preppers:** The cook-and-store convenience is genuinely useful for batch cooking and weekly prep.

**Visual cooks:** If you like to watch your food and adjust on the fly, the glass design delivers.

**Upgraders from the original Crispi:** The temperature control and extra modes make a real difference.

## Competition Comparison

| Feature | Crispi Pro | Original Crispi | Ninja Foodi DZ201 |
|---------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Price** | ~$280 | ~$170 | ~$200 |
| **Containers** | 6qt + 2.5qt glass | 6qt glass | 2 x 4qt baskets |
| **Temperature Control** | Digital precision | Preset only | Digital precision |
| **Cooking Modes** | 6 modes | 4 modes | 6 modes |
| **Dual Cooking** | No | No | Yes |
| **Glass/Non-toxic** | Yes | Yes | No (coated baskets) |
| **Watch Food Cook** | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Cook & Store** | Yes | Yes | No |

**The verdict:** If non-toxic glass is your priority, the Crispi Pro is the best option. If you need dual-zone cooking for different foods simultaneously, look at the Foodi DZ201—but you'll sacrifice the glass benefits.

## Bottom Line

The Ninja Crispi Pro isn't just a TikTok trend. The glass design solves real problems: no plastic anxiety, cook-and-store convenience, and the ability to actually watch your food.

Yes, it's expensive. Yes, it only cooks one thing at a time. But for health-conscious cooks who want the air fryer experience without the coating concerns, nothing else comes close.

The Pro's digital temperature control and extra cooking modes justify the upgrade over the original Crispi—especially if the included 6qt and 2.5qt containers fit your household size.
