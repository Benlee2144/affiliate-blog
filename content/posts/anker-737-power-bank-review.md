**You're carrying three chargers and a power bank.** One for phone, one for laptop, one for earbuds—plus a battery pack that can only charge phones. Your bag is a cable disaster.

What if one device could charge everything at full speed?

**Our verdict: The Anker 737 Power Bank is the best high-capacity portable charger, delivering enough power to charge laptops while remaining TSA-approved for air travel.**

## Our Pick: Anker 737 Power Bank

![Anker 737 Power Bank](/images/products/anker-powerbank-1.jpg)

**Quick take:** 24,000mAh capacity, 140W USB-C output that charges MacBook Pro at full speed, smart digital display showing watts and time remaining, and recharges itself in 1.5 hours. The do-everything power bank.

**Best for:**
- Travelers who charge laptops on the go
- Remote workers at coffee shops
- Anyone wanting to consolidate charging gear
- Power users with multiple devices

**Skip if:**
- You only charge phones (smaller banks are cheaper)
- Weight matters more than capacity
- Budget is tight ($110 is premium pricing)

## Why the Anker 737 Changes the Game

### 140W USB-C Output

![Anker 737 fast charging capability](/images/products/anker-powerbank-2.jpg)

Most power banks max out at 18-30W—enough for phones, useless for laptops. The 737 delivers 140W through USB-C, matching your MacBook's wall charger speed.

One USB-C port charges your laptop. The other charges your phone. Simultaneously. At speed.

### Smart Digital Display

The built-in display shows:
- Exact wattage being delivered
- Time remaining until empty
- Time remaining until full (when recharging)

No guessing. No wondering if it's actually charging.

### TSA-Approved Capacity

![Anker 737 24,000mAh capacity](/images/products/anker-powerbank-4.jpg)

At 87.68Wh, the 737 is just under the 100Wh TSA limit for carry-on lithium batteries. You get maximum legal capacity without the airport hassle.

### Fast Self-Recharging

With a 140W charger, the 737 goes from empty to full in about 1.5 hours. No more overnight charging—plug it in while you shower and it's ready.

## The Honest Downsides

### It's Heavy

At 1.3 pounds, you'll notice it in your bag. Physics applies—energy density has limits. If you prioritize weight over capacity, look at the Anker 735 (smaller, lighter).

### Premium Price

$110 is expensive for a power bank. You're paying for the 140W output capability and premium build. Budget-conscious users can find phones-only options for $30-40.

### Brick-Like Shape

The rectangular design doesn't slip into pockets. It's a bag item, not a pocket item.

## Who Should Buy the Anker 737

**Perfect for you if:**
- You travel with a laptop
- Multiple devices need charging daily
- You value consolidating gear
- Flight-ready capacity matters

**Consider alternatives if:**
- You only charge phones (Anker 335 at $40)
- Weight is critical (Anker 735 at 12oz)
- Budget is limited

## How It Compares

| Feature | Anker 737 | Anker 735 | Apple MagSafe Battery |
|---------|----------|----------|----------------------|
| Capacity | 24,000mAh | 12,000mAh | 1,460mAh |
| Max Output | 140W | 65W | 15W |
| Weight | 1.3 lbs | 0.75 lbs | 0.25 lbs |
| Laptop Charging | Yes | Slow | No |
| Price | $110 | $60 | $99 |

The 737 is the only option for full-speed laptop charging. The 735 is better for phone-only users who want some laptop emergency power. Apple's option is iPhone-only.

## The Bottom Line

The Anker 737 Power Bank is the ultimate portable charging solution for anyone who travels with a laptop. The ability to charge a MacBook Pro at full speed while simultaneously charging a phone eliminates the need for multiple chargers.

It's heavy and expensive. But if laptop charging matters, nothing else compares.
