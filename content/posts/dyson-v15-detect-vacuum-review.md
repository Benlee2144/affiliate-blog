faq:
  - question: "Is the Dyson V15 Detect worth it?"
    answer: "For most homes, yes—if budget allows. The laser genuinely reveals dust you'd miss, and suction is class-leading. But cheaper Dysons clean nearly as well."
  - question: "How long does Dyson V15 battery last?"
    answer: "Up to 60 minutes in Eco mode, 8 minutes in Boost. Real-world mixed use: 30-40 minutes. Battery issues have been reported by some owners."
  - question: "Dyson V15 vs V12 Detect Slim?"
    answer: "V15 has stronger suction (125 vs 150 AW) and larger bin. V12 is lighter and cheaper. For most homes, V12 is sufficient."
  - question: "Is the laser gimmicky?"
    answer: "No—it genuinely reveals fine dust on hard floors you'd otherwise miss. Less useful on carpet but transforms hard floor cleaning."

**You vacuumed yesterday but the floor still looks dirty.** Fine dust collects in corners you can't see. Pet hair hides in carpet fibers. Your current vacuum misses more than it catches.

The Dyson V15 Detect promises to change that—with a literal laser that reveals invisible dust and a sensor that counts particles in real-time.

**Our verdict: The Dyson V15 Detect is the best cordless vacuum you can buy, delivering genuinely useful innovations alongside class-leading suction. But at $750, cheaper Dysons clean nearly as well for most homes.**

## Our Pick: Dyson V15 Detect

![Dyson V15 Detect Vacuum](/images/products/dyson-v15-1.jpg)

**Quick take:** 124 AW sealed suction (best in class), green laser that reveals microscopic dust on hard floors, piezo sensor that counts particles and displays them on-screen, and automatic suction adjustment based on floor type.

**Best for:**
- Allergy sufferers who need thorough cleaning
- Homes with hard floors where dust accumulates
- Tech enthusiasts who appreciate innovation
- Anyone who wants the absolute best

**Skip if:**
- Budget is a concern (V12 or V8 clean well)
- You primarily have carpet (laser less useful)
- Weight matters (6.8 lbs is heavy for a stick vac)
- You need long battery for large homes

## The Laser Is Not a Gimmick

Let's address this immediately: the green laser genuinely reveals dust you'd otherwise miss. On hard floors, it illuminates fine particles that are invisible under normal lighting.

Is it necessary? No. Is it satisfying and useful? Absolutely. You'll find yourself cleaning corners you've ignored for years.

### Piezo Sensor: Real-Time Particle Counting

The LCD screen displays exactly how many particles you're picking up, categorized by size. When counts drop, you know the floor is clean. It's oddly addictive—and ensures you don't stop too early.

### Auto Mode Actually Works

The vacuum detects floor type and adjusts suction automatically. More power on carpet, less on hard floors to conserve battery. It's seamless and effective.

## Class-Leading Suction

At 124 AW of sealed suction, the V15 outperforms every cordless competitor. Even Dyson's own V12 tops out at 150 AW, but the V15's sustained performance and airflow make it the better deep cleaner.

VacuumWars testing confirmed: *"Still sets the benchmark for cordless performance."*

---

## The Honest Downsides

### Battery Issues Are Real

Reddit reports of batteries degrading outside warranty are common. One user described the cyclone unit dying just after warranty, requiring a $150 repair.

Dyson's customer service is generally good, but be aware this is a known issue with some units.

### It's Heavy

At 6.8 lbs, the V15 is notably heavier than competitors. Extended overhead cleaning (ceiling fans, high shelves) gets tiring quickly.

### Trigger Requires Constant Pressure

You must hold the trigger the entire time you vacuum. Some users find this fatiguing over long sessions.

### Small Dustbin

Less than 1 liter capacity means frequent emptying in dusty environments.

## Who Should Buy the Dyson V15 Detect

**Perfect for you if:**
- You want the best cordless vacuum available
- Hard floors are a significant part of your home
- Allergies make thorough cleaning important
- Tech features excite you

**Consider alternatives if:**
- Budget matters (Dyson V12 or V8)
- You need lighter weight
- Your home is primarily carpet

---

## The Bottom Line

The Dyson V15 Detect justifies its flagship status with genuine innovations that improve cleaning—not just spec sheet bragging. The laser and particle counter make you a better cleaner.

But at $750, it's a premium you're paying for technology rather than dramatically better cleaning versus the $500 V12. Buy it if you want the best; buy the V12 if you want excellent value.
