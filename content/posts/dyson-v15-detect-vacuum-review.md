**You vacuumed yesterday but the floor still looks dirty.** Fine dust collects in corners you can't see. Pet hair hides in carpet fibers. Your current vacuum misses more than it catches.

The Dyson V15 Detect promises to change that—with a literal laser that reveals invisible dust and a sensor that counts particles in real-time.

**Our verdict: The Dyson V15 Detect is the best cordless vacuum you can buy, delivering genuinely useful innovations alongside class-leading suction. But at $750, cheaper Dysons clean nearly as well for most homes.**

We've used the V15 Detect daily for over two years, comparing it against V12 Detect Slim, V8 Animal, and premium competitors from Shark and Tineco. We've tested suction performance, battery longevity, filter maintenance, and real-world cleaning effectiveness across different floor types and household conditions.

The V15 represents the pinnacle of cordless vacuum technology, but the innovations come at a premium that may not be worth it for every household.
