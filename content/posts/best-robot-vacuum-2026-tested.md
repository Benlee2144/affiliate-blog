faq:
  - question: "What is the best robot vacuum for pet hair?"
    answer: "The Roborock Q5 Pro handles pet hair better than most at this price point. Its 5500Pa suction is strong enough to pull embedded fur from area rugs, and the rubber brush roller doesn't tangle with long cat hair the way bristle brushes do. For a home with multiple heavy-shedding dogs, consider stepping up to the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra."
  - question: "Is a robot vacuum worth it?"
    answer: "For most homes, yes. The math works simply: if a robot vacuum runs daily and you vacuum weekly, you get 6 extra cleaning cycles per week. Hair, dust, and debris get cleaned before they accumulate rather than after. The floors stay noticeably cleaner with zero effort. The ROI is real, especially with pets or kids."
  - question: "Do robot vacuums work on carpet?"
    answer: "Yes, but with limitations. Most robot vacuums handle low-pile carpet and area rugs well. High-pile or shag rugs can either be navigated poorly or avoided entirely depending on the vacuum's sensors. The Roborock Q5 Pro handles medium-pile area rugs well, as does the Roomba j7+. None replace an upright vacuum for deep carpet cleaning."
  - question: "How often should I run my robot vacuum?"
    answer: "Daily for homes with pets. Every other day for homes without pets but with regular foot traffic. Weekly for lightly-used spaces. The advantage of robot vacuums is scheduling — once you set a daily 2am run, you genuinely stop thinking about it."
  - question: "What is the difference between LiDAR and camera navigation in robot vacuums?"
    answer: "LiDAR (laser-based mapping) works in the dark, maps quickly, and creates precise floor plans — usually complete after one run. Camera-based navigation (like Roomba's vSLAM) takes several runs to map a space and doesn't work in low light. LiDAR vacuums generally cost more but navigate faster and more reliably."

My living situation: 1,200 square feet, hardwood floors throughout, two area rugs, two cats who shed dramatically, and enough furniture to make any navigation system earn its keep.

I ran four robot vacuums for 30 days each, alternating between them, keeping track of what I had to manually clean up after each one, when they got stuck, and what legitimately impressed or frustrated me.

Here's what I found — sorted by how much I'd actually recommend each one.

## What Made This Test Different

Most robot vacuum reviews run the machines on clean floors in controlled conditions. I deliberately didn't clean before any test run. I let the hair accumulate for 48 hours, then ran the vacuum. I wanted to see how they handled real loads, not ideal-condition demos.

I also left things in the way — power cables semi-managed, a pet water bowl that moves slightly from run to run, socks on the floor because that's a thing that happens. Real life, not a showroom.

## 1. Roborock Q5 Pro — The One I Kept

Price: ~$350 | Suction: 5500Pa | Navigation: LiDAR

The [Roborock Q5 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVZKPD2N?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) mapped my entire apartment on its first run in 34 minutes. Completely. I came back to a full floor plan with every room correctly identified except it labeled the hallway as a "room," which is technically accurate if pedantic.

After mapping, I set up a daily 2am cleaning schedule. I did not think about my floors for three weeks. That's the whole promise of robot vacuums delivered.

**On cat hair:** My cats are domestic longhairs. Their fur gets everywhere and is spectacular at weaving into rug fibers. The Q5 Pro's rubber main brush handles it dramatically better than bristle brushes — hair wraps around rubber much less than around bristles, so the brush goes weeks without needing cleaning instead of days.

**Navigation accuracy:** LiDAR gives the Q5 Pro a significant edge over camera-based systems. It knows exactly where it is at every moment. It never vacuumed the same strip twice, never missed a section, never got confused about room boundaries.

**What annoyed me:** The Roborock app asks you to create an account and connects to the cloud. If you care about local-only smart home devices, this is a dealbreaker. There's no local control option. If you don't care about that, the app is actually quite good — the zone cleaning and no-go zones work reliably.

**The verdict:** For most people with hard floors, area rugs, and especially pets, this is the right answer at this price. I bought a second one for my parents.

## 2. Eufy RoboVac L35 Hybrid — The Surprise Value Pick

Price: ~$220 | Suction: 3000Pa | Navigation: LiDAR

The [Eufy RoboVac L35 Hybrid](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BJ9FTQV?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) costs $130 less than the Q5 Pro and closes the gap more than you'd expect.

Mapping was accurate and completed in 38 minutes (4 more than the Q5 Pro, negligible). Navigation was very good — it covered all floor sections, though it occasionally took inefficient paths between areas on opposite sides of the apartment. Not a problem, just noticeable.

The suction at 3000Pa is meaningfully lower than the Q5 Pro's 5500Pa. On hardwood floors, this didn't matter — hair and debris picked up fine. On the area rugs, the difference showed: the Eufy left some embedded cat hair that the Q5 Pro would pull up.

**The hybrid functionality:** The L35 can mop as well as vacuum. I tested this — it's fine for light mopping of hardwood. If you want something that vacuums AND does light wet cleaning, this is the only machine in this test that does both. The mop is a cloth pad attached to a small water tank, and it does the job without being impressive.

**Who should buy this:** Anyone without area rugs, or with short-haired pets, who wants LiDAR navigation for $130 less than the Q5 Pro.

## 3. iRobot Roomba j7+ — Great at One Thing, Overpriced for Most

Price: ~$550 | Suction: Unspecified (moderate) | Navigation: vSLAM camera

The [Roomba j7+](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094NYKTFM?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) costs $550 and comes with a self-emptying base that holds 60 days of debris.

It is genuinely excellent at one thing: avoiding obstacles. Roomba calls this "PrecisionVision" — the camera-based system identifies objects like cords, socks, and pet waste and routes around them. In my testing, it avoided every cable, navigated around the slightly-displaced pet bowl, and never got stuck.

The issue: you're paying $550 for that one feature, and the rest of the vacuum is mediocre for the price. Navigation takes 3–4 runs to fully map a space versus one run for LiDAR. The suction is adequate but not strong. Cat hair performance was distinctly worse than the Q5 Pro.

**Who should buy this:** Households with dogs who have accidents indoors (the j7+ has specific pet waste avoidance), or anywhere cords and cables are genuinely impossible to manage. For anyone else, the $200 premium over the Q5 Pro is very hard to justify.

## 4. Shark AI Ultra — The One I'd Return

Price: ~$400 | Suction: Unspecified | Navigation: Shark AI

The [Shark AI Ultra](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LLP4K7F?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) has good marketing. The cleaning performance was average. The navigation frustration was not average.

Over my 30 days, it got stuck 8 times. The Q5 Pro got stuck once. The Eufy got stuck twice. The Roomba never got stuck. The Shark got stuck on the transition strip between my kitchen and hallway — a strip it should have mapped and handled after the first two encounters — on six separate occasions.

The suction was adequate for hardwood floors but notably weaker than the Q5 Pro on rugs. The app was functional but slower and less polished than Roborock's or Eufy's.

There's nothing specifically broken about the Shark AI Ultra. It's just the weakest performer in a group that includes clearly better options at the same or lower price points.

## 30-Day Results: The Actual Numbers

I tracked how often each vacuum required manual intervention over 30 days:

| Vacuum | Times Stuck | Manual Hair Removal | Missed Sections |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Roborock Q5 Pro | 1 | Every 2 weeks | None |
| Eufy L35 Hybrid | 2 | Weekly | Rare |
| Roomba j7+ | 0 | Weekly | Occasional (mapping) |
| Shark AI Ultra | 8 | Weekly | Occasional |

## What to Buy

**For most homes:** [Roborock Q5 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVZKPD2N?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) at $350. Best all-around performance, excellent pet hair handling, reliable mapping.

**Budget pick:** [Eufy RoboVac L35 Hybrid](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BJ9FTQV?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) at $220. 85% of the Q5 Pro's performance at 63% of the cost. Adds mopping if you want it.

**If obstacle avoidance is critical:** [Roomba j7+](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094NYKTFM?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) at $550. The best at avoiding things. Buy it only if that's your primary concern.

**Skip:** Shark AI Ultra in this price range. The navigation frustration isn't worth it when better options exist.

The one metric I care about most with robot vacuums: after 30 days of daily runs, how often did I think about my floors? With the Q5 Pro, the answer was zero. That's the bar.
