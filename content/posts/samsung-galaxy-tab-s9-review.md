**iPads are great—if you're in Apple's ecosystem.** But if you use Android, Windows, or want real file management, the iPad's limitations frustrate. The "best tablet" only works for Apple users.

Samsung's Galaxy Tab S9 is the Android answer—and it's finally competitive.

**Our verdict: The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 is the best Android tablet available, delivering iPad-level hardware with Android's flexibility and Samsung's productivity features.**

## Our Pick: Samsung Galaxy Tab S9

![Samsung Galaxy Tab S9](/images/products/samsung-tab-s9-1.jpg)

**Quick take:** 11" Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with 120Hz, Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, S Pen included, DeX desktop mode, IP68 water resistance, and 8,400mAh battery. The complete Android tablet package.

**Best for:**
- Android users wanting a premium tablet
- Note-takers and artists (S Pen included)
- Productivity users (DeX mode)
- Samsung ecosystem owners

**Skip if:**
- You're deep in Apple ecosystem (get iPad)

- Budget is under $600

## Why the Tab S9 Finally Competes

### S Pen Included (Apple Charges Extra)

The S Pen comes in the box—no $130 add-on purchase like Apple Pencil. It magnetically attaches to the back for wireless charging and stays with your tablet.

For note-taking, drawing, and markup, the S Pen is natural and responsive with minimal latency.

### DeX Desktop Mode

Connect to a monitor or use on-tablet to get a desktop-style interface with resizable windows. Run Android apps like desktop programs. It's not Windows, but it handles productivity surprisingly well.

### AMOLED Display Excellence

The Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel delivers:
- True blacks (individual pixel dimming)
- 120Hz adaptive refresh
- 2560x1600 resolution
- Outdoor visibility (anti-reflective)

Movie watching and content creation look stunning.

### IP68 Water Resistance

The only premium tablet with IP68 rating. Use it by the pool, in the rain, or survive kitchen spills. iPad offers no water resistance at any price.

---

## The Honest Downsides

### Android Tablet Apps Lag Behind

iPadOS has years of optimized tablet apps. Many Android apps are still phone apps stretched to fit. This is improving but still noticeable.

### Premium Price

At $850, you're paying flagship prices. The iPad 10th gen costs $449. You're paying for features, not value.

### Samsung Bloatware

Expect pre-installed Samsung apps you won't use. Most can be disabled but not fully removed.

### No MagSafe Ecosystem

iPad's magnetic accessory ecosystem doesn't exist here. Keyboards and stands require different solutions.

## Who Should Buy Galaxy Tab S9

**Perfect for you if:**
- You use Android phones and want ecosystem continuity
- S Pen functionality matters
- DeX productivity appeals to you
- You want water resistance in a tablet

**Consider alternatives if:**
- Apple ecosystem is your world (iPad)
- Budget matters (iPad 10th gen or Tab S9 FE)
- Tablet app ecosystem is priority

## The Bottom Line

The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 is the Android tablet that iPad users can finally envy. The included S Pen, DeX mode, and stunning AMOLED display create a complete package for Android users.

The app ecosystem still trails iPadOS, but if you're not in Apple's world, the Tab S9 is the clear choice.
