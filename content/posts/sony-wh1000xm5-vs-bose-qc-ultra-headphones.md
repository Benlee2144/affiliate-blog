I already wrote a [detailed comparison of these two](/best-noise-cancelling-headphones-2026/) a while back. But that was more of a roundup. This is the deep dive — the obsessive, side-by-side, "I wore different headphones on each ear like a weirdo on a flight" comparison that nobody asked for but everyone apparently wants.

Eight months. Both headphones. Every day. Let's go.

## Price Check: February 2026

The [Sony WH-1000XM5](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) has been hovering around $298 on Amazon lately. It launched at $400 and has come down significantly. Camelcamelcamel shows it hitting $248 during Black Friday.

The [Bose QC Ultra](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCZ26B5V?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) still sits at $379-429. It goes on sale less frequently and the discounts are smaller. You might catch it at $349 during major sales.

That's a $80-130 gap depending on timing. Not negligible.

## Noise Cancellation: The Main Event

Everyone wants to know which one blocks more noise. After eight months of planes, coffee shops, open offices, and my neighbor's apparently infinite home renovation project, here's what I've found:

**Low-frequency noise** (airplane engine, AC hum, traffic): Bose wins. The QC Ultra kills low rumble slightly better. On a recent 4-hour flight I switched between them multiple times and the Bose consistently made the cabin feel quieter.

**Mid-frequency noise** (voices, typing, office chatter): Dead tie. Both reduce conversation to a mumble. Neither completely eliminates it — no ANC headphone does.

**High-frequency noise** (keyboard clicks, dishes clanking): Sony wins slightly. The XM5 seems to handle sharp, transient sounds a bit better.

**Overall ANC verdict:** Bose by a tiny margin. But I need to stress — tiny. We're talking maybe 2-3dB difference. Most people couldn't tell in a blind test.

The bigger differentiator? The Sony creates this subtle ear pressure that some people hate. I've gotten used to it, but my coworker tried mine and immediately said it felt "weird." The Bose doesn't do this at all. If you're sensitive to that kind of thing, it's a dealbreaker.

## Sound Quality

Here's where things get subjective and forums get angry.

**Sony XM5:** Warm. Punchy bass. Vocals sit slightly forward. Great for pop, hip-hop, EDM, podcasts. The LDAC codec support means if you have an Android phone you can stream higher quality bluetooth audio.

**Bose QC Ultra:** Wider soundstage. More neutral presentation. Better instrument separation. The Immersive Audio mode is actually good — it makes music sound like it's coming from speakers around you rather than inside your head. Classical, jazz, and acoustic music shine here.

I listen to a lot of everything. Rock on weekends, podcasts during work, some hip-hop at the gym. For my taste the Sony edges it out because that bass presence just makes music more fun. But I completely understand people who prefer the Bose's more refined sound.

## Comfort: 8-Hour Workday Test

Both are comfortable for the first 2-3 hours. After that, differences emerge.

**Sony:** Lighter clamp force. Softer headband padding. But the ear cups are shallower, so if you have bigger ears they touch the driver. By hour 6, my right ear starts getting warm.

**Bose:** Deeper ear cups. More room inside. But the clamp force is slightly tighter, which gives me a mild headache around hour 7-8.

It's a wash. Different trade-offs, both fine for most people. If you wear glasses, the Bose's deeper cups accomodate the arms a bit better.

## Battery Life

Sony: 30 hours. Bose: 24 hours. In practice I charge the Sony every 3-4 days and the Bose every 2-3 days with similar use.

This matters more than people think. The Sony's battery advantage means less charging anxiety during travel. On a 3-day work trip I don't even bring the Sony charger. The Bose needs a top-up by day 2.

**Winner: Sony, clearly.**

## Call Quality

Both are fine for Zoom calls. The Sony has a slight edge in noisy environments — the 4-mic beamforming array does better at isolating your voice from background noise.

The Bose has this annoying thing where it occasionally cuts out for a split second during calls. Not often, maybe once every few calls, but enough that a coworker mentioned it.

**Winner: Sony.**

## The Foldability Thing

Sony doesn't fold. Just lays flat. Bose folds. This matters if you travel with a small bag. The Bose case is noticeably more compact.

For desk-to-meeting use in an office? Doesn't matter. For frequent flyers? Bose wins here.

## The Verdict

**Buy the [Sony WH-1000XM5](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) if:**
- You want the best value (it's $80+ cheaper)
- Battery life matters
- You prefer punchy, fun-sounding music
- Call quality is important
- You have an Android with LDAC support

**Buy the [Bose QC Ultra](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCZ26B5V?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) if:**
- ANC is your absolute top priority
- You prefer neutral, spacious sound
- That Sony ear pressure thing bugs you
- You need compact travel storage
- You wear glasses (deeper cups help)

For most people reading this? Get the Sony. It's cheaper, lasts longer, sounds great, and the ANC difference is marginal. The $80 you save can go toward a good pair of [wireless earbuds for the gym](/best-wireless-earbuds-for-running-2026/).

But if you find the Bose on sale under $350? Grab it. At that price it's an incredible headphone and you wont regret it.

I'm keeping both because apparently I have a problem.
