Here's the question that haunts every vacuum shopper: is Dyson actually twice as good as Shark, or are you just paying for the name?

I've been running this experiment since last summer. The [Dyson V15 Detect](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0978KKK3K?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The [Shark Stratos Cordless](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7CQPWK1?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Same house, same floors, same two dogs who shed enough fur to knit a third dog every week.

Six months of data. Let's talk about it.

## The Price Gap

- Dyson V15 Detect: ~$750
- Shark Stratos Cordless: ~$350

That's not a small difference. That's a PS5 worth of difference. So the Dyson better be doing something special.

## Suction Power

The Dyson V15 produces 230 AW of suction. The Shark Stratos hits about 200 AW. On paper, Dyson wins.

In practice? On hard floors, both pick up everything. I mean everything. Dust, crumbs, dog hair, those tiny Lego pieces my nephew leaves everywhere — both handle it all on a single pass.

On carpet is where the Dyson pulls ahead. Deep carpet cleaning, pulling up embedded pet hair, getting into the carpet fibers — the V15 is noticeably better. I vacuumed the living room carpet with the Shark, then immediately ran the Dyson over the same area. The Dyson's bin had more debris in it. Not a huge amount, but enough to see.

**Winner: Dyson, especially on carpet.**

## The Laser Thing

The Dyson V15's green laser illuminates dust particles on hard floors. I wrote about this in my [full Dyson V15 review](/dyson-v15-detect-vacuum-review/) — it's not a gimmick. You genuinely see dust you'd otherwise miss.

The Shark has... clean sense IQ, which automatically adjusts suction based on debris detection. It works, but it's invisible. You don't get that satisfying "oh god look at all that dust" moment.

For hard floors specifically, the Dyson's laser makes you a more thorough cleaner. Is it worth $400 extra? Debatable. But it's genuinely useful.

## Battery Life

| Mode | Dyson V15 | Shark Stratos |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Eco | 60 min | 50 min |
| Auto | 30-40 min | 35-40 min |
| Boost/Max | 8 min | 10 min |

Pretty comparable honestly. Both get me through my ~1,500 sq ft house on a single charge in auto mode. The Dyson's eco mode lasts longer but the suction reduction is more aggressive.

**Winner: Tie.**

## Weight & Ergonomics

The Shark Stratos is lighter and more maneuverable. It flexes under furniture more easily and the DuoClean head glides on both hard floors and carpet without switching heads.

The Dyson V15 feels more premium but it's heavier at 6.8 lbs. Overhead cleaning — ceiling fans, high shelves — gets tiring faster. And that trigger you have to hold the entire time? After 30 minutes my hand is cramping.

The Shark has a button you click once. On/off. No holding required. Such a small thing but it makes a massive difference in actual use.

**Winner: Shark.**

## Maintenance & Reliability

Both have washable filters and easy-empty dustbins. The Dyson's bin is smaller though, which means more frequent emptying with pets.

Long-term reliability is where things get interesting. My Shark has been flawless — the anti-odor technology actually works and the brushroll hasn't tangled once despite two long-haired dogs.

The Dyson community on Reddit has a lot of battery degradation complaints at the 18-24 month mark. Mine is only 6 months in so I can't speak to this personally, but it's worth noting. Dyson's customer service is generally good about replacements, but shouldn't be needed on a $750 vacuum after 18 months.

If you want a [robot vacuum to handle daily maintenance](/best-robot-vacuums-for-pet-hair-2026/) between manual sessions, that's a solid approach for pet owners.

**Winner: Shark (so far).**

## Attachments & Accessories

Dyson: Multiple specialized heads, the laser head, crevice tool, mini motorized tool, dusting brush. Everything locks in with satisfying clicks.

Shark: Fewer attachments but arguably more practical ones. The pet multi-tool is excellent. The self-cleaning brushroll genuinely prevents hair wraps.

**Winner: Dyson on quantity, Shark on practicality.**

## The Bottom Line

Here's my honest take after six months:

**The Shark Stratos gives you 85% of the Dyson's cleaning performance at 47% of the price.** That math is hard to argue with.

The Dyson V15 IS better. The laser is useful, the suction is stronger on carpet, and the build quality feels more premium. If money isn't a major factor and you want the absolute best cordless vacuum, [get the Dyson](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0978KKK3K?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20).

But for most people? The [Shark Stratos](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7CQPWK1?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) at $350 is the smarter buy. It cleans well, it's lighter, the trigger doesn't cramp your hand, and you have $400 left over.

If you're in an apartment, you probably don't even need these flagships — check out our [cordless vacuums for apartments guide](/best-cordless-vacuums-for-apartments-2026/) for more budget-friendly picks.

My dogs don't care which vacuum chases them around the house. Neither should you, probably.
