I'll be honest — I thought doorway pull up bars were one of those things people buy in January and then use as a towel rack by March. Like an ab roller or a shake weight. Pure impulse purchase energy.

Turns out I was the idiot.

My buddy has had an [Iron Age pull up bar](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TB24V9C?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) hanging in his hallway for like two years. Every time I walked past it I'd do a couple pull ups without even thinking about it. After a few months of visiting his place I realized my back actually looked different and I hadn't set foot in a gym. That's when it clicked — the convenience factor is the whole point.

So I bought four of them. Tested each one for at least two weeks. Here's the quick breakdown before I get into details.

## Quick Comparison

| Pull Up Bar | Price | Weight Limit | Grip Options | Screws Needed? | My Rating |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Iron Age Smart Hook** | ~$35 | 300 lbs | 6 grips | No | ⭐ 4.5/5 |
| **ProsourceFit Multi-Grip** | ~$28 | 300 lbs | 12 grips | No | ⭐ 4.3/5 |
| **Yes4All Door Bar** | ~$22 | 300 lbs | 4 grips | No | ⭐ 3.8/5 |
| **Iron Gym Original** | ~$30 | 300 lbs | 3 grips | No | ⭐ 3.5/5 |

**Short answer:** The Iron Age is the one I kept on my bedroom door. The ProsourceFit is the better value if you want versatility. Skip the Iron Gym unless you find it for under $20.

## Why I Was Skeptical (And Why That Was Dumb)

My main fear was the bar falling and me eating hardwood floor at 7am. Which, fair. I watched a YouTube compilation of pull up bar fails before buying and almost talked myself out of it. Coop from Garage Gym Reviews has a good breakdown on this — most failures come from either cheap bars or people installing them wrong. The leverage-style bars that hook over your door trim are way safer than those tension rod ones that just wedge between the frame. Those pressure-mounted bars are basically a concussion waiting to happen.

The other concern was door frame damage. I rent my apartment so thats a real issue. But after two months of testing, only one bar left visible marks — and it was the one I expected.

## Iron Age Pull Up Bar — The One I Actually Use

![Iron Age Pull Up Bar mounted on doorway](/images/products/iron-age-pull-up-bar-1.jpg)

The [Iron Age](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TB24V9C?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) gets recommended constantly on r/bodyweightfitness and r/homegym, and honestly I understand why now. The "smart hook" design sounds like marketing fluff but it genuinely makes a difference — the hooks automatically adjust to your door trim thickness so there's zero wobble.

I weigh about 195 lbs and this thing doesn't budge. Not even a little. I've been doing weighted pull ups with a 25lb dumbbell between my feet (sketchy, I know) and it still feels rock solid.

**What I like:**
- Six different grip positions including neutral grip which is easier on your shoulders
- The foam padding is actually thick and hasn't compressed after 2 months
- Takes about 15 seconds to put up and take down
- No marks on my door frame at all

**What I don't like:**
- It sticks out from the wall about 4 inches when mounted, so you'll bonk your head if you're not paying attention
- The red accent color is kinda ugly tbh
- At 195 lbs doing kipping pull ups (don't judge me) there's a tiny bit of flex. Strict form and it's solid tho

**Who it's for:** Anyone who wants a reliable daily-use bar and doesn't mind spending the extra $7-10 over budget options.

## ProsourceFit Multi-Grip — Best Bang for Your Buck

![ProsourceFit Multi-Grip Pull Up Bar](/images/products/prosourcefit-multi-grip-pull-up-bar-1.jpg)

The [ProsourceFit Multi-Grip](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YQUP7Q?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) is the bar that Wirecutter recommended for years and I can see why. Twelve grip positions is overkill for most people but I've actually found myself using like 7 of them depending on what muscle I'm targeting.

Wide grip pull ups, close grip chin ups, neutral grip, hammer grip — you name it. The bar basically gives you a whole upper body workout station for less than a month of gym membership.

I actually tested this one first and almost didn't bother trying the others. It's that good. But there is one issue.

**The door frame marks.** After about a week I noticed slight indentations on the top of my door trim where the hooks sit. Nothing crazy — you'd only see them if you were looking — but for a rental thats annoying. Some people on the bodyweightfitness subreddit recommend putting a folded towel between the hooks and the trim. I tried that and it actually works, but then it wobbles slightly more.

**What I like:**
- 12 grip positions — genuinely useful, not just marketing
- Very sturdy construction, heavier than the Iron Age
- The angled grips near the wall are great for wide-grip work
- Around $28 which is hard to argue with

**What I don't like:**
- Left marks on my door trim (even with the foam pads)
- Heavier and bulkier to take down
- The push up handles on the bottom are useless — just do push ups on the floor

**Who it's for:** Someone building a serious home workout routine who wants grip variety without mounting anything to the wall.

## Yes4All Door Pull Up Bar — Cheapest That's Still Decent

![Yes4All Door Pull Up Bar](/images/products/yes4all-pull-up-bar-1.jpg)

At around $22, the [Yes4All](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BNPJG92L?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) is the cheapest bar I tested that I'd actually reccommend to someone. It's basic. Four grip positions, decent foam, holds 300 lbs supposedly (I didn't test that limit, obviously).

Here's the thing about budget pull up bars — they all look basically identical. They're probably all made in the same factory with different logos stamped on. The Yes4All distinguished itself by having slightly better padding than the other cheap ones I looked at, and the hooks felt a bit more substantial.

But I won't lie. It feels cheaper than the Iron Age or ProsourceFit. The foam is thinner, the steel is thinner (you can tell by the weight), and there's a slight creak when you first grab on that goes away once your weight settles. Never felt unsafe though.

**My take:** If you just want to bang out some pull ups and chin ups a few times a day and don't care about grip variety, save the money. But if you're over 200 lbs or plan on doing anything dynamic, spend the extra $13 on the Iron Age.

## Iron Gym Total Upper Body — The OG (That's Showing Its Age)

![Iron Gym Pull Up Bar](/images/products/iron-gym-pull-up-bar-1.jpg)

The [Iron Gym](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001EJMS6K?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) is the one everybody remembers from those late-night infomercials in like 2009. It's the pull up bar that started the whole doorway bar trend. And honestly... it's fine. Just fine.

I included it because it's still one of the top sellers on Amazon and I wanted to see if the nostalgia was justified. It's not. The design hasn't really changed in 15+ years and competitors have caught up and passed it. The grip options are limited, the foam is meh, and it's not as stable as newer bars.

The one advantage is that almost every door frame in America has been tested with this thing at some point, so you know it'll fit. Theres that.

**My take:** Only buy this if you find it on clearance somewhere. The ProsourceFit does everything the Iron Gym does but better and for a similar price.

## Do Doorway Pull Up Bars Actually Damage Your Door Frame?

This was my biggest worry and I tracked it carefully. After 2 months:

- **Iron Age:** Zero visible marks. The smart hook padding is legit.
- **ProsourceFit:** Slight indentations on top trim. Fixable with spackle.
- **Yes4All:** Minor scuff marks from the foam. Wiped off with a Magic Eraser.
- **Iron Gym:** Light marks similar to ProsourceFit.

If you're in a rental, the Iron Age is worth the premium just for this reason. Or do the towel trick. Or accept that you're losing a few bucks off your security deposit — still cheaper than a gym membership.

## What About Those Tension Rod / Screw-In Bars?

I specifically avoided tension rod bars (the ones that extend and press against the inside of your doorframe). I've seen too many videos of people crashing to the ground mid-rep. The physics just don't work as well — you're relying on friction instead of leverage.

Screw-in bars like the Garren Fitness Maximiza are genuinely great and more stable than any leverage bar, but they require drilling into your door frame. If you own your place and don't mind two small holes, seriously consider going that route. Wirecutter's been recommending the Elevated XL for this reason.

But for most people in apartments? Leverage bars are the move.

## How I Actually Use Mine

I put the Iron Age on my bedroom doorway. Every time I walk through — before coffee, after a meeting, heading to the kitchen — I knock out a few reps. Some days thats 3 sets of 5. Some days its scattered singles throughout the day that add up to 30-40 total pull ups.

This is called "greasing the groove" and it's an actual training method, not just me being lazy. Pavel Tsatsouline wrote about it. Basically you never go to failure, you just accumulate volume throughout the day. After two months my max set went from 8 to 13 without ever doing a traditional "workout."

## The Verdict

Get the **[Iron Age](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TB24V9C?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20)** if you want the best no-damage, solid daily bar. Get the **[ProsourceFit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YQUP7Q?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20)** if you want more grip options for less money and don't mind minor trim marks. Get the **[Yes4All](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BNPJG92L?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20)** if you're on a tight budget and just want to start doing pull ups today.

And skip the Iron Gym. It had its moment. That moment was 2009.
