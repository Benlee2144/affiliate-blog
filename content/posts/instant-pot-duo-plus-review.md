faq:
  - question: "Is the Instant Pot Duo Plus worth it over the regular Duo?"
    answer: "Yes. For $20 more, you get a larger display, whisper-quiet steam release (75dB vs 85dB), ability to edit cooking time mid-cycle, and extra preset programs for eggs and cakes."
  - question: "Can the Instant Pot Duo Plus replace a slow cooker?"
    answer: "Absolutely. The slow cook function works identically to a standalone Crock-Pot, with low, medium, and high heat settings and timers up to 24 hours."
  - question: "How long does an Instant Pot take to come to pressure?"
    answer: "Typically 10-15 minutes depending on the amount of liquid and food. This time isn't included in recipe cooking times, so factor it in when planning meals."
  - question: "Is the Instant Pot safe to leave unattended?"
    answer: "Yes. It has 10+ safety mechanisms including overheat protection, lid lock detection, and automatic pressure control. Many owners use the slow cook function overnight."

**Your kitchen counter is a graveyard of single-purpose appliances.** The rice cooker you use twice a month. The slow cooker gathering dust. The yogurt maker from that health kick in 2019.

What if one appliance could replace all of them—and actually get used daily?

**Our verdict: The Instant Pot Duo Plus is the best multi-cooker for anyone ready to reclaim counter space without sacrificing cooking versatility.**

## Our Pick: Instant Pot Duo Plus 6QT

![Instant Pot Duo Plus 6QT product image with detailed view and professional lighting](/images/products/instant-pot-duo-plus-1.jpg)

**Quick take:** 9 appliances in one with a whisper-quiet steam release that won't wake the house. The 6-quart capacity handles meals for up to 6 people, and the 800+ included recipes eliminate guesswork.

**Best for:**
- Busy families who need fast weeknight dinners
- Meal preppers cooking large batches
- Anyone tired of multiple single-use appliances
- Apartment dwellers with limited kitchen space

**Skip if:**
- You only cook for 1-2 people (get the 3-quart instead)
- You want air frying built-in (get the Duo Crisp)
- You rarely cook at home

## Why the Instant Pot Duo Plus Stands Out

### 9 Appliances, One Footprint

The Duo Plus replaces:
1. Pressure cooker
2. Slow cooker
3. Rice cooker
4. Steamer
5. Sauté pan
6. Yogurt maker
7. Warmer
8. Sterilizer
9. Sous vide

Good Housekeeping selected the Duo Plus as their top pick, noting it *"offers everything that the best-selling Duo does—and then some—without much additional cost."*

### Whisper-Quiet Steam Release

The Duo Plus releases steam at 75dB max—that's 10 decibels quieter than standard models. For context, 10dB is perceived as roughly half as loud. No more startling yourself (or your pets) when the pressure releases.

### Edit Cooking Time Mid-Cycle

Unlike the basic Duo, the Plus lets you adjust cooking time and pressure level while the machine is running. No more canceling and restarting when you realize you added the wrong time.

### Actually Readable Display

The upgraded LED display is larger and brighter than the standard Duo. If you've ever squinted at tiny appliance readouts, you'll appreciate this immediately.

## What It Actually Does Well

### Pressure Cooking (The Main Event)

Pressure cooking is where the Instant Pot shines. Tough cuts of meat that take 3 hours in a slow cooker? Done in 45 minutes. Dried beans without overnight soaking? 30 minutes.

TechRadar's testing found *"the results of what the Instant Pot Duo Plus can do, whether it's rice, Thai curry, or chili, are as good as its price tag is low."*

### Slow Cooking

The slow cook function works exactly like a standalone Crock-Pot. Set it in the morning, come home to dinner. The only difference: the pot is stainless steel instead of ceramic, so browning happens faster.

### Rice Cooking

The dedicated rice program produces consistently fluffy rice—better than most standalone rice cookers at this price point. The pot even detects the type of rice and adjusts automatically.

## The Honest Downsides

### The Learning Curve Is Real

Don't expect perfect results on day one. Pressure cooking requires understanding:
- How much liquid you need (minimum 1 cup)
- Natural release vs quick release
- How long it takes to reach pressure (10-15 min, not included in cook time)

Expect 2-3 weeks of experimentation before you're comfortable.

### Sealing Issues Happen

The most common complaint: the pot won't pressurize. Usually this means:
- The sealing ring isn't seated properly
- The valve is set to "venting" instead of "sealing"
- There's food debris on the sealing ring

Replace the sealing ring every 12 months—they wear out.

### Burn Notices (Especially on 8-Quart)

The 8-quart model is prone to "burn" errors, especially when sautéing before pressure cooking. The 6-quart rarely has this issue. If you get burn notices, deglaze thoroughly after sautéing.

### Sauté Function Runs Hot

The sauté function can scorch food quickly. Use medium heat instead of high, and don't walk away. It's meant for browning, not extended cooking.

## Who Should Buy the Instant Pot Duo Plus

**Perfect for you if:**
- You cook for 3-6 people regularly
- You want to consolidate kitchen appliances
- Fast weeknight dinners are a priority
- You're willing to learn pressure cooking basics

**Consider alternatives if:**
- You want WiFi/app control (get the Pro Plus)
- You need air frying built-in (get the Duo Crisp)
- You cook for 1-2 people (get the 3-quart Mini)

## How It Compares

| Feature | Instant Pot Duo Plus | Ninja Foodi | Crock-Pot Express |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Functions | 9-in-1 | 9-in-1 | 8-in-1 |
| Capacity | 6 quarts | 6.5 quarts | 6 quarts |
| Whisper Quiet | Yes | No | No |
| Air Fry | No | Yes | No |
| Price | $99.99 | $149.99 | $79.99 |
| App Recipes | 800+ | 150+ | 50+ |

The Ninja Foodi adds air frying but costs 50% more and isn't as quiet. The Crock-Pot Express is cheaper but has fewer features and a smaller recipe library. The Duo Plus hits the sweet spot.

## Pro Tips From Long-Term Owners

1. **Buy a second sealing ring** - Use one for savory, one for sweet. The silicone absorbs odors.
2. **Don't fill past 2/3** - Leave room for pressure to build safely.
3. **Natural release for meat** - Quick release makes proteins tough.
4. **The app is actually useful** - Step-by-step recipes with automatic timer sync.

---

## The Bottom Line

The Instant Pot Duo Plus earns its cult following. It genuinely replaces multiple appliances, cooks faster than traditional methods, and the whisper-quiet release makes it livable in open floor plans.

The learning curve is real, but worth it. After a few weeks, you'll wonder how you cooked without it.
