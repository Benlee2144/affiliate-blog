faq:
  - question: "Is charcoal grilling better than gas?"
    answer: "For flavor, yes—charcoal produces smoke that gas can't replicate. For convenience, gas wins. Charcoal requires more time and skill but rewards with superior taste."
  - question: "Why is Weber Kettle the best charcoal grill?"
    answer: "The shape creates perfect convection for even cooking, the vents provide precise temperature control, and the build quality lasts decades. Simple design, perfected."
  - question: "How long does a Weber Kettle last?"
    answer: "With basic care, 15-20+ years. The bowl and lid are porcelain-enameled steel that resists rust. Replace grates every 5-10 years."
  - question: "Can you smoke on a Weber Kettle?"
    answer: "Yes—the two-zone setup and vent control enable low-and-slow smoking. It's not a dedicated smoker but produces excellent results with practice."

**Gas grills are convenient.** Push a button, turn a dial, grill a burger. But something's missing. That smoky flavor, that primal satisfaction, that connection to cooking over fire.

Charcoal grilling isn't harder—it's different. And no charcoal grill does it better than the Weber Kettle.

**Our verdict: The Weber Original Kettle 22" is the best charcoal grill for anyone ready to discover what real grilling tastes like. The design hasn't changed much since 1952 because it didn't need to.**

## Our Pick: Weber Original Kettle Premium 22"

**Quick take:** 22" diameter provides 363 sq inches of cooking space, porcelain-enameled bowl and lid for durability, one-touch cleaning system, hinged grate for adding charcoal, and the legendary Weber shape that creates perfect convection airflow.

**Best for:**
- Anyone wanting real grilled flavor
- Backyard cooks ready to level up from gas
- Beginner charcoal users (forgiving to learn on)
- Budget-conscious grillers wanting quality

**Skip if:**
- Convenience is paramount (gas is easier)

## Why the Weber Kettle Has Lasted 70 Years

![Weber Kettle Grill close-up](/images/products/weber-kettle-2.jpg)

### The Shape Is Engineering Genius

The spherical kettle shape isn't just iconic—it creates perfect airflow. Hot air rises around food, reflects off the lid, and circulates evenly. No hot spots, no cold zones.

This is why a $219 Weber cooks better than $500 barrel grills. The physics work.

### Temperature Control That Works

Two vents—bottom for intake, top for exhaust—give you precision heat control:
- Wide open: 500°F+ for searing
- Half closed: 350°F for roasting
- Barely cracked: 225°F for smoking

Master the vents, master the grill.

### Build Quality That Lasts Decades

Porcelain-enameled steel resists rust and won't burn through. Weber owners regularly report 15-20 years of use with basic care. Your grill will outlast several gas grills at the same price point.

### Two-Zone Cooking

Place coals on one side, leave the other empty. Direct heat for searing, indirect for roasting. One grill, multiple cooking methods, infinite possibilities.

## The Honest Downsides

### Charcoal Requires Effort

You'll wait 15-20 minutes for coals to ash over. You'll manage vents during cooking. You'll clean ash afterward. This is the trade-off for superior flavor.

### Weather Affects Cooking

Cold, wind, and rain change heat dynamics. You'll learn to adapt, but it's more variable than gas. Consider a windbreak for your setup.

### No Built-In Thermometer

The Premium model includes a thermometer, but base models don't. An instant-read thermometer is essential either way.

### Ash Cleanup Required

The one-touch cleaning system helps, but you're still dealing with ash. Empty it before each use to maintain airflow.

## Who Should Buy the Weber Kettle

**Perfect for you if:**
- Flavor is your priority
- You'll use it regularly (weekly or more)
- You enjoy the grilling process, not just the result
- Budget is under $250

**Consider alternatives if:**
- Convenience matters most (gas grill)
- You need set-and-forget (pellet smoker)
- You want massive capacity (larger Weber or offset)

## The Bottom Line

Your grandfather grilled on one. Your grandchildren can too.
