## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How much oil should I use in an air fryer?**
A: Most foods need no oil. For extra crispiness, use 1-2 teaspoons of oil spray. Air fryers work by circulating hot air, not oil.

**Q: Can I cook multiple foods at once?**
A: Yes, but they should require similar temperatures and cooking times. Use accessory racks or separators for different foods.

**Q: How do these budget air fryers compare to expensive models?**
A: For basic air frying, they perform 85-90% as well as $300+ models. You sacrifice advanced features like app connectivity and premium materials, not core cooking performance.

**Q: What's the most important feature in an air fryer?**
A: Even heat distribution and adequate capacity for your needs. Temperature accuracy and easy cleanup are also crucial for daily use satisfaction.

## Maintenance and Longevity Tips

**Daily Cleaning:**
- Wash basket and accessories after each use
- Wipe interior with damp cloth
- Clean exterior with appropriate cleaner

**Deep Cleaning:**
- Monthly deep clean with baking soda paste
- Check heating element for buildup
- Inspect power cord for damage
