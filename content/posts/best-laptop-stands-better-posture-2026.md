description: "After 3 months of neck pain from working on my laptop, I bought 3 different stands. The cheapest one won. Here's why the Lamicall beats the $50 options."
summary: "I spent $100 testing three laptop stands after my chiropractor told me my forward head posture was getting worse. The Lamicall Adjustable Stand at $25 is genuinely better than the Rain Design mStand I wanted to love. The Nulaxy C1 is overkill for most people but great if you switch between sitting and standing."

Last September my chiropractor looked at my X-ray and said something I didn't love hearing: "Your head is sitting about two inches in front of where it should be." Apparently this is called forward head posture and it's basically what happens when you stare down at a laptop screen for 8 hours a day, five days a week, for... I dunno, a decade?

She told me to get a laptop stand. I said sure and then didn't do it for six weeks because I'm exactly that kind of person.

Then one morning in November I woke up and couldn't turn my head to the left without this shooting pain going down into my shoulder. That was the push I needed. I ordered three different laptop stands over the next month because — and I've learned this about myself — I apparently cannot just buy one of anything and be done with it.

## The first week — Rain Design mStand

I started with the [Rain Design mStand](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000OOYECC?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) because it kept showing up on every "best laptop stand" list. Wirecutter recommends it as their budget pick. It's like $43 on Amazon and it looks *gorgeous* — single piece of aluminum, very Apple Store vibes. I have a space gray MacBook Pro and the silver mStand next to it looked clean as hell on my desk.

But here's the problem nobody mentions in reviews. The mStand has a fixed height. You can't adjust it at all. It raises your laptop about 5.9 inches off the desk and tilts it at one specific angle. For me — I'm 5'11" — that put the top of my screen at about chin level. Better than flat on the desk, sure. But not eye level. Not even close.

I used it for about 10 days. My neck felt maybe 30% better? The improvement was real but not enough. I was still tilting my head down slightly to see the screen and after a full work day I could feel it.

Also the cable management hole in the back is nice in theory but my MacBook charger cable is too thick to route through it cleanly. Minor complaint but annoying.

## Week three — Nulaxy C1

So I ordered the [Nulaxy C1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YTHMM3B?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) next. This one's around $30 and it's adjustable — like, aggressively adjustable. It's got this Z-shaped arm thing with dual hinges so you can set it at basically any height and angle you want.

First impression: the build quality is solid. All aluminum, no plastic. The hinges are stiff enough that my 4.7 pound MacBook Pro doesn't make it sag at all. I cranked it up to eye level and immediately felt the difference. Like, within the first hour of using it I could tell this was a totally diffrent experience than the mStand.

The problem with the Nulaxy is that it's... fiddly. Every time I bumped my desk or adjusted my chair, I'd want to tweak the angle slightly. And the dual-hinge design means you're adjusting two points to get the right combo of height and tilt. It took me like 3 minutes each time to get it dialed in perfectly. Not a huge deal but it got old.

And honestly it's kind of ugly? It looks like a piece of medical equipment sitting on your desk. My wife walked into my office and said "what is that robot arm thing." So if aesthetics matter to you — and they shouldn't, but they do to some people — fair warning.

I kept the Nulaxy for two weeks. My neck was genuinely feeling better. But I couldn't shake the feeling that there had to be something simpler.

## Month two — Lamicall Adjustable Stand

The [Lamicall Adjustable Laptop Stand](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M94BTYC?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) was kind of an impulse buy. It was $25 on Amazon, had like 40,000 reviews with a 4.7 average, and TechRadar called it their top pick. I almost didn't order it because I figured at that price it'd be flimsy garbage.

It's not flimsy garbage. At all.

The Lamicall is this simple folding stand with a single adjustment mechanism. You set the angle you want and it clicks into place. Takes about 5 seconds. The aluminum feels solid, the rubber pads grip my MacBook without scratching it, and it folds completely flat so I can toss it in my backpack when I work from a coffee shop.

Here's what sold me: I set it up once, found the angle that puts my screen at eye level, and I haven't touched it since. That was back in December. Three months now and I just plop my laptop on it every morning and start working. No fiddling, no re-adjusting, no thinking about it.

My neck pain is like 90% gone. I still get some stiffness if I work really late — past midnight my posture goes to crap no matter what — but the constant dull ache I had from September through November is just... gone. My chiropractor noticed the improvement at my January visit without me even mentioning the stand.

## So which one should you actually get

**Most people:** Get the [Lamicall](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M94BTYC?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20). It's $25, it works, it's adjustable enough for 90% of situations, and it folds flat for travel. This is the boring correct answer.

**If you want something beautiful on your desk:** The [Rain Design mStand](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000OOYECC?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) is genuinely stunning. But only get it if you're on the shorter side (under 5'8" maybe?) where the fixed height actually puts the screen at the right level for you. Or if you use an external monitor and just want to elevate the laptop as a second screen — it's perfect for that.

**If you switch between sitting and standing:** The [Nulaxy C1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YTHMM3B?tag=amazonfi08e0c-20) is the only one that has enough range to work at both heights. If you have a standing desk converter or you move around a lot during the day, the extra adjustability is worth the hassle.

## A couple things I learned

You need an external keyboard and mouse. I know that sounds obvious but I didn't think about it at first and tried to type on my laptop while it was elevated. That lasted about 4 minutes before I realized how stupid it felt — my arms were up at shoulder height like I was playing a tiny piano on a shelf. I already had a Logitech MX Keys from my desktop setup so I just started using that. If you dont have an external keyboard yet, budget another $30-50 for one. The laptop stand is useless without it.

Also, the angle matters more than the height. I spent weeks obsessing over getting the screen to exact eye level but honestly what made the biggest difference was the tilt. When the screen tilts back toward you slightly, you stop craning your neck forward. Even a few degrees of tilt changed everything for me.

One more thing — if you're on video calls a lot, a laptop stand dramatically improves your camera angle. Instead of that unflattering "looking up your nose" shot, you get a straight-on angle that looks way more professional. My coworkers actually commented on it. Small perk but worth mentioning.

## Three months later

I'm writing this on a Tuesday evening in February. My MacBook is on the Lamicall stand. My neck doesn't hurt. The mStand is in a drawer because I couldn't bring myself to return something that pretty. The Nulaxy is in a box somewhere in my closet.

Twenty five bucks. That's what it cost to fix a problem I'd been ignoring for years. Kinda makes me feel dumb for waiting so long but hey — at least I can turn my head to the left now without wincing.
