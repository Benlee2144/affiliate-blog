## Get in Touch

Have a question, suggestion, or spot something that needs correcting? We'd love to hear from you.

### What to reach out about:
- **Product suggestions** — Want us to review something specific? Let us know.
- **Corrections** — If we got something wrong, we want to fix it. Accuracy matters.
- **Press & partnerships** — Media inquiries and collaboration proposals welcome.
- **General feedback** — Tell us what's working and what isn't.

### Email
**ben@researchedpick.com**

### Response Time
We typically respond within 1-2 business days. Product review requests are added to our research queue — we can't review everything, but we read every suggestion.

### For Brands & PR
If you're a brand or PR agency, please note: we do not accept payment for reviews, and we don't guarantee favorable coverage. We're happy to consider products for review on our own editorial terms.
