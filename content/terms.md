## Agreement

By accessing researchedpick.com ("Researched Picks," "we," "our"), you agree to these terms.

## What We Do

We provide independent product reviews and buying guides based on research from Amazon reviews, Reddit discussions, forum posts, and other public sources. Our goal is to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions.

## Affiliate Disclosure

We participate in the Amazon Associates Program and other affiliate programs. This means:
- Some links on our site are affiliate links
- We may earn a commission when you purchase through these links
- Commissions do not affect the price you pay
- Affiliate relationships do not influence our editorial opinions
- We clearly disclose affiliate relationships on every relevant page

## Editorial Independence

Our reviews reflect our honest research and opinions. We are not paid by manufacturers or retailers to write favorable reviews. Affiliate commissions are earned on purchases, not on editorial coverage.

## Accuracy

We strive for accuracy but cannot guarantee that all information is current or error-free. Product prices, availability, features, and specifications change frequently. Always verify critical details with the manufacturer or retailer before purchasing.

## Not Professional Advice

Our content is for informational purposes only. It does not constitute professional, medical, legal, or financial advice. Product reviews are based on publicly available information and owner experiences.

## Intellectual Property

All original content on Researched Picks — including text, images, design, and code — is protected by copyright. You may share links to our content but may not reproduce it without permission.

## User Conduct

Don't scrape, crawl excessively, or use automated tools to extract our content at scale. Normal browsing and reasonable use of RSS feeds is fine.

## Limitation of Liability

Researched Picks is provided "as is." We are not liable for any damages resulting from your use of our site or reliance on our content, including purchasing decisions based on our reviews.

## Changes

We may update these terms at any time. Continued use of the site constitutes acceptance of updated terms.
