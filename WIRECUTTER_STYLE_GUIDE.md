This document defines the writing style and format for all blog posts on this affiliate site. Every post should follow these guidelines to match the quality and trustworthiness of Wirecutter reviews.

---

## Core Philosophy

1. **Reader service first** - Even if content doesn't make money, prioritize helping the reader
2. **"Good enough" recommendations** - Focus on products where value and price intersect, not just top-of-the-line options
3. **Research depth** - Treat every review like you're recommending to friends and family
4. **Balanced honesty** - Every product has weaknesses; always disclose them

---

## Article Structure

### 1. Headline Format
```
Best [Product Category] for [Year/Use Case]
```
- Primary keyword at the beginning
- Supplementary context in parentheses if needed
- Examples:
  - "Best Blenders for Smoothies in 2024"
  - "Best Robot Vacuums (Tested and Reviewed)"
  - "Best Air Fryers for Small Kitchens"

### 2. Opening Section (First 150 words)

**Start with the reader's pain point:**
> "If you've ever [common frustration], you know how important it is to find [product] that actually works."

**Establish credibility immediately:**
> "After researching [X] products and analyzing hundreds of verified owner reviews..."

**Bold the main focus** in the first paragraph to help readers (and search engines) understand the topic instantly.

### 3. Quick Pick Box (Immediately After Intro)

Present the top recommendation right away for quick-decision buyers:

```markdown

### 4. Product Sections Structure

For each recommended product:

**The downsides:**

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone
- **Conversational but authoritative** - Write like a knowledgeable friend, not a salesperson
- **Empathetic** - Acknowledge the reader's frustration or need
- **Direct** - Get to the point; respect reader's time
- **Balanced** - Never sound like marketing copy

### Language Patterns

**DO use:**
- "After researching..."
- "Real owners report that..."
- "The main downside is..."
- "This is ideal for people who..."
- "Skip this if you..."
- "Based on verified reviews..."
- "The consensus among long-term users..."

**DON'T use:**
- "Amazing!" "Incredible!" "Must-have!"
- "You won't believe..."
- "Act now!" "Limited time!"
- Excessive superlatives
- Fake urgency
- Marketing buzzwords

### Specificity Over Generality

**Bad:** "This blender is powerful."
**Good:** "This blender's 1400-watt motor pulverizes ice in under 10 seconds, according to multiple owner tests."

**Bad:** "Customers love it."
**Good:** "On Reddit's r/Blenders, owners consistently praise the quiet operation, with several noting it doesn't wake sleeping babies."

## Research Requirements

Before writing any review:

1. **Gather real feedback from:**
   - Reddit threads (r/[relevant subreddit])
   - Amazon reviews (filter for verified, 3-4 star reviews for honest takes)
   - YouTube comments on review videos
   - Specialty forums
   - Facebook groups

2. **Identify patterns:**
   - What do owners love after 6+ months?
   - What breaks or disappoints?
   - What unexpected benefits do people discover?
   - What common misconceptions exist?

3. **Verify specifications:**
   - Pull actual specs from manufacturer
   - Note dimensions, weight, wattage
   - Include warranty information

---

## Visual Guidelines

- **Product images** for each recommendation
- **Comparison tables** for specs
- **Red/contrasting affiliate buttons** that stand out
- **Adequate whitespace** between sections
- **Bulleted lists** for scanability

---

## SEO Requirements

1. **Primary keyword in:**

   - First paragraph
   - At least one H2
   - Meta description

2. **Schema markup:**

   - Review schema with ratings

   - BreadcrumbList for navigation

3. **Internal linking:**

## Example Opening Paragraph

> Finding the right robot vacuum shouldn't require a PhD in robotics. After digging through months of Reddit discussions, analyzing 500+ verified Amazon reviews, and cross-referencing specs from 23 different models, we've identified the vacuums that actually deliver on their promises—and the ones that leave owners frustrated within weeks.
>
> **Our top pick for most homes is the [Product Name]**, which consistently earns praise from long-term owners for its navigation accuracy and surprisingly quiet operation. But if you have pets, thick carpets, or a tight budget, we've got specific recommendations for those situations too.
